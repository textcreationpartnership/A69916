            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Samuel Sheppard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
SHERIFF Elect for the
CITY of LONDON
And COUNTY of
MIDDLESEX.</head>
                  <p>SIR, when I ſaw ſo conſiderable
a part of the Nation join'd in
the deſign of ſettling the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade upon a new Foundation, I
thought I could ſcarce pitch upon a
more ſeaſonable juncture, than this,
to make my Authors appear in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to give us an account of their
<pb facs="tcp:57955:3"/>
ten Years Tranſactions, among the
ſame Nations, where in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
our <hi>Indian</hi> Trade is to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on to the Honour and Advantage
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. I will not
pretend to enlarge my ſelf here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the uſefulneſs of Commerce in
General, or of that of the <hi>Indies</hi> in
Particular; if the ſtation I am in did
not excuſe me from undertaking
that task, the univerſal conſent of all
civilized Nations, who look upon
traffick as one of the main Pillars of
the proſperity of the Common-Wealth,
is a demonſtration ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to over-balance any thing that
can be ſaid upon ſo ample a ſubject
by a private hand. And as to
what relates to the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade in
particular, our Neighbours the
<pb facs="tcp:57955:3"/>
                     <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have made it the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
ſtone of the preſent flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
State of their Common-wealth,
are living inſtances, to convince us
what improvements may be made in
this kind, if managed by a dextrous
hand. I might in this place have
made ſome Reflections, perhaps not
altogether uſeleſs, upon the preſent
condition of ſome of the <hi>Indian</hi>
Countries, eſpecially upon thoſe on
the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> who being
divided into ſo many petty Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
and for the moſt part Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
very convenient for Traffick,
ſeem to invite us to be ſharers with
them in the vaſt advantages the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade affords: But when I
conſidered with my ſelf the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
ability of the Perſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:57955:4"/>
whom I was making my addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and on the other hand what
ſlender ſhare of experience I had
in theſe affairs, I was not without
reaſon afraid I ſhould run my ſelf
into the ſame Error a certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſopher did, who
being Honoured with a Viſit by that
renown'd <hi>African</hi> Warriour <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
entertain'd him with a very
long and tedious leſſon concerning
the duty of a General. I will inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
confeſs, it was chiefly upon
the ſcore of your Merits, and the
reputation you have ſo deſervedly
acquired in the management of an
affair of the utmoſt conſequence to
the Glory and Advantage of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that when theſe
<hi>Indian</hi> Travellers after their return
<pb facs="tcp:57955:4"/>
home from a long and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Voyage, were to make their
appearance among us; I judg'd I
could not recommend them to the
protection of any other perſon, than
your ſelf, who both for your Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Zeal, have given ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
demonſtrations to the World in
what relates to the affairs of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
that, as your Judgment, by
the conſent of all ſides, is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
ſo theſe Travellers have all
the reaſon imaginable to promiſe
themſelves due Encouragement from
your generous inclinations. Before I
conclude; I cannot paſs by in ſilence,
and apply with ſome ſmall alterations
here, the words Mr. <hi>Rennefort</hi> makes
uſe of in reſpect of the <hi>French Eaſt-India</hi>
Company; that ſince our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:57955:5"/>
                     <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the whole Nation, under the
protection of his preſent Majeſty,
who by his moſt Glorious Actions,
has made himſelf both Admired and
Redoubted in far diſtant Countries,
we have all the reaſon to hope, that
under the Direction of ſuch Perſons,
who have an equal ſhare of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Conduct and Honour, they
may in time, at leaſt equalize, if not
out-vie the reſt of the <hi>European</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

PREEACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>THE enſuing Treatiſe, falling by
chance into my hands; after a
full peruſal of it, I thought it highly
worth my care of making it appear in
the World under an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garb, at
a time, when our Nation has a very
near concern in Foreign Affairs, and
its Genius ſeems more than ever bent
upon the improvement of its Knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:57955:6"/>
in relation to Foreign Countries. I lay
this down as a general meaning, which
I ſuppoſe few will contradict, that as
thoſe who want the conveniency of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
their curioſity by travelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
themſelves, (eſpecially in far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Countries) cannot in any way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſupply this defect, than by applying
themſelves to ſuch Authors, as by a long
experience having had the opportunity of
informing themſelves concerning the true
conſtitution of theſe-Countries, are in all
probability, the moſt proper Perſons to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their end, as having at their own
expence, endeavoured to improve the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
knowledge of Mankind. It cannot
be denied, but that in our time, there
have appeared more Books of this kind
abroad, than perhaps all the Ages before
us can produce; and that the <hi>French</hi>
in particular have been more liberal
in furniſhing us with the Relations of
their Travels, than any other Nation:
But not to deviate from the truth, it
<pb facs="tcp:57955:6"/>
muſt be alſo confeſs'd, That as to what
relates to their Voyages to the <hi>Indies,</hi>
they are for the moſt part confin'd to the
Deſcription of ſome particular Country or
other, whereas the enſuing Treatiſe gives
a view of a great part of that vaſt
Country, comprehended under the Name
of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> It may alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that many of our Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
in their Deſcriptions of theſe far
diſtant Countries, have affected a way
of ſurpriſing rather than inſtructing their
Readers; they repreſent both the Climate
of the <hi>Indies</hi> and its products, as the
effects of a quite different, if not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
principle of Nature, from what we
find in our parts, whereas it may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evident, to all ſuch as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the whole without prejudice, that
Nature performs its operations in all
parts of the World, according to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fundamental Laws, that the
Heats and Colds of theſe ſeveral Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
differ only in degrees, and that
<pb facs="tcp:57955:7"/>
the Monſters of <hi>Africa</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi>
are no more ſurpriſing to the Inhabitants
of theſe parts, than the Beaſts that
are commonly ſeen and bred among us
are to the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Moſt of theſe
Authors ſeem to have been ſeized with
an itch of pleaſing their Readers, and
of creating in them an Opinion of their
own more than ordinary Ability, and
inſight into the Manners and Cuſtoms of
thoſe Nations they have treated of, which
has made them diſpoſe their Treatiſes
into large Volumes by many Digreſſions,
artificial Reflections, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of their own, ſuch as they
thought moſt ſuitable to the genious of
ſuch as they intended to pleaſe. I don't
in the leaſt queſtion, but that thoſe who
will peruſe the enſuing Account, will
ſoon be convinced, that Monſieur <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
its Author, (though a Man of a
more than ordinary Capacity and Learning)
has throughout the whole Treatiſe acted
with more Sincerity than Artifice, and
<pb facs="tcp:57955:7"/>
to make uſe of his own Words in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
That, <hi>tho' after a ſtay of Ten
Years in the</hi> Indies, <hi>he was by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen
Accident obliged to return
to</hi> France <hi>much ſooner than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
whereby he was prevented
of making ſome particular Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which might have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
diverting to the Reader; and
that therefore, if this Relation might
not be equally pleaſing to all who
affect Novelties beyond Truths, and
are taken with Voluminous pieces;
nevertheleſs, he could aſſure them,
that as his intention had been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the whole into as ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
as the nature of the thing would
admit of, without entangling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Relation of many ſtrange
Adventures, which he could not but
Judge to be nauſeous to perſons of
a ſolid Judgment, ſo he had taken
all the imaginable care not to inſert
any thing but what was in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb facs="tcp:57955:8"/>
conſonant to Truth, and
what he had not by hearſay and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Credit of others, but by his
own Experience, during his ſtay in
the</hi> Indies. I cannot paſs by in ſilence,
that the Appendix concerning the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> ought to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a ſingular piece, if it be conſidered
how little that is Authentick there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
upon that Subject, and that Monſieur
<hi>Dellon,</hi> being a Doctor of Phyſick, his
profeſſion entitles him to have had a better
inſight into it, than moſt other Travellers
could pretend to. That nothing might be
wanting, which in all probability could
give the better ſatisfaction to the publick,
I judged it not unadviſable, to add by
way of Supplement, ſome matters relating
to the <hi>Indies,</hi> taken out of Monſieur <hi>de
Rennefort</hi>'s Hiſtory of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
which having a near affinity to many things
related by Monſieur <hi>Dellon,</hi> I thought
might much illuſtrate ſome matters, which
queſtionleſs for brevity's ſake he thought
<pb facs="tcp:57955:8"/>
fit to paſs by in ſilence; ſome others there
are, which not being come to Monſieur
<hi>Dellon</hi>'s knowledge, (as about Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Hay</hi>'s expedition againſt the
Iſle of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Iſle of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi>) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
would be no ungrateful Addition to
render the whole the more compleat; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when I made due reflection upon
the Character of Monſieur <hi>de Rennefort,</hi>
who having been intruſted for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time with the management of Affairs
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the <hi>French Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
Company, might claim the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with Monſieur <hi>Dellon;</hi> but I will
not enlarge my ſelf any further upon the
merits of my Author, being ſufficiently
convinced that as his laſt Chapter, which
contains a project for the improvement of
the <hi>French Eaſt-India</hi> Company, ſhews
him to be a perſon of a more than ordinary
Capacity and Experience in the <hi>Indian</hi>
Affairs, ſo the whole Book will be in all
probability accepted of by the unbiaſs'd
<pb facs="tcp:57955:9"/>
and judicious Reader, if not, as the moſt
ample and perfect in all its parts, at leaſt
as the moſt Sincere and extenſive for its
bulk, as repreſenting in a ſmall compaſs
a ſhort view of many of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        <p>ALL Mankind have a certain Natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
to Curioſity, but Young people
have commonly a greater Inclination to
ſatisfie their own Fancies, taken up for the moſt
part with Novelties, than thoſe who are arrived
to a ripe Age. For my part having always been
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57955:17"/>
inflamed with a moſt ardent deſire of Travelling,
after I had finiſhed the courſe of my Studies, I
left <hi>Paris</hi> with no other reſolution than to leave
<hi>France,</hi> and by the Converſation with Foreigners
to make my ſelf acquainted with their Genius
and Manners.</p>
                        <p>Being informed that the Royal <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was Equipping ſome Ships at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> I
directed my courſe thither, and entred my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Service; in a Ship of 400 Tuns, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Strong,</hi> Commanded by Captain <hi>Merchand,</hi>
and left that Harbour within 14 days after, in the
Company of the <hi>Golden-Eagle.</hi> But we had ſcarce
been a few Hours under Sail, when a Calm ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
us to come to an Anchor, near the Iſle of
<hi>Groy,</hi> about 2 Leagues from the <hi>French</hi> Shoar,
where we remain'd till the next Morning, when
with a freſh Gale of North-Eaſt Wind, we ſoon
loſt ſight of our Native Shoar.</p>
                        <p>The firſt inconveniency I was ſenſible of in this
Voyage, was, my being Sea-Sick, as well as all
the reſt, who were moſt acquainted before with
the Watery Element, but a little time cured us of
that Diſtemper. For 8 days together we ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Sea and the Skies, when at laſt our
Sentries diſcovered 4 Sails to the Windward of
us, and we being at that time engaged in a War
with <hi>Spain,</hi> our Captain was getting every thing
ready, in caſe there ſhould be any occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
the Enemy; ordering the <hi>Golden-Eagle,</hi>
who was a nimbler Sailer than we, to endeavour
to come up with them firſt: But having ſoon
diſcovered them to be <hi>French</hi> Ships, bound for
<hi>Newfoundland,</hi> we continu'd our Voyage without
any further hinderance; till ſome days after, when
a moſt furious Tempeſt aroſe, which laſted near
18 Hours, put us into no ſmall diſtreſs; ſcarce
had we eſcaped that danger, but we were thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, no leſs dangerous than the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For our Ship Sprung a Leak, and then fell in ſuch
a vaſt quantity of Water, that both our Pumps
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57955:17"/>
not being ſufficient to exhauſt it, it was thought
moſt adviſable, to make, together with the <hi>Golden-Eagle,</hi>
the beſt of our way to the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt.
Whilſt we were juſt upon the point of putting it
in execution, the Leak was by good Fortune diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and ſoon ſtopped, ſo that we ſpent the
remainder of the day in making good Cheer for
Joy of having eſcaped ſo imminent a danger. The
next Morning by break of day, we came in ſight
of a very large Ship, and the <hi>Golden-Eagle</hi> being
advanced within Canon-Shot, gave her the Signal
of Striking; but finding her not to comply imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
with our deſire, we put out the White Flag,
when ſhe inſtantly lower'd her Top Sail. This
was a Ship belonging to <hi>Diep,</hi> which was bound
to <hi>Senegal,</hi> where they Trade in Ivory, Feathers
and Gold-Duſt; the Captain's Name was <hi>Le Moyne,</hi>
and having thus continued our Voyage together,
we left him near the Mouth of the River <hi>Niger,</hi>
directing our Courſe to <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> where we Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in 6 Weeks, after our firſt departure out of
<hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>But I will not pretend to enlarge my ſelf here

any longer than was abſolutely requiſite, for the

                        <p>For after a ſtay of 12 days, the Wind being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable,
we weighed Anchor, and put again to
Sea, but before we loſt ſight of the Shoar, we
were becalmed for ſome days, during which time,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57955:18"/>
we diverted our ſelves with Fiſhing, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with catching of <hi>Requins,</hi> (which the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi>

                           </note> only to have the ſatisfaction of
ſelling them; they being ſeldom made uſe of, but
in caſe of the greateſt extremity, becauſe their

There are ſome of them of that bigneſs as to be
able to ſwallow a Man; the Females bear their
Young ones in their Bellies, without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of any Spawn; I have found a dozen
Young ones at a time, which being cut out of
the Bellies of the Old ones, were a Foot and half
long, and much better to Eat than the great
ones.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo ſeveral other ſorts of Fiſh catch'd
betwixt the two Tropicks, and among others
thoſe call'd by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Bonites.</note> 
                           <hi>Bonites,</hi> a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious

The flying Fiſh are to be met with here in great
numbers,<note place="margin">Flying-Fiſh.</note> reſembling both in ſhape and bigneſs
our Herrings, their Wings being not unlike to
thoſe of a Flittermouſe. They cannot make uſe
of them unleſs they be wet, which makes them
continually plunge themſelves in the Water. It
is the moſt ſurprizing thing in the World to ſee
them in ſo prodigious numbers, if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that they are ſurrounded in both the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by their Enemies, who gives them but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

when they ſeek for refuge in the Water, the
<hi>Bonites,</hi> who have a great antipathy againſt them,
devour them; ſo that whereever they are, they are
never ſecure againſt their Enemies.</p>
                        <p>We paſs'd the Equinoctial Line about 3 Weeks
after our departure from <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> and about a
Month after the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hitherto we had met with no conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter,
during our whole Voyage; but now the
<hi>Golden-Eagle</hi> being deſtitute of freſh Water, we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57955:19"/>
were fain to ſhare ours with her, and the next
following Night were ſeparated from one another
by ſtreſs of Weather. But the worſt of all was,
that our Ship ſprung 3 days after another Leak,
which let in the Water in ſuch a quantity, as to
make us ſufficiently ſenſible of our imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
of being inevitably loſt, we being at too great
a diſtance from any Shoar, to entertain the leaſt
hopes of eſcaping the danger; but we had once
more the good Fortune to find out the Leak,
and by applying ſpeedy and effectual Remedies
againſt the evil, that a few Hours before threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
our deſtruction, the hopes of Life began to
reſettle our diſturbed Spirits, which the fear of
our approaching cruel Fate and the conſtant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
had almoſt robb'd us of before. But we
were for a conſiderable time afterwards peſtered
by contrary Winds, ſo that we did not come
within ſight of the Iſle <hi>Dauphin,</hi> (called by the
<hi>Portugueſes,</hi> St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and by the Natives, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar,</hi>)
under the 26th Degree of the Southern
Latitude, till 7 Weeks after we had paſs'd the
Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide, which did
not a little ſurprize our Pilates, who believed to
have been on the Eaſt ſide of it. We were put
to no ſmall trouble, and endur'd great fatigues,
before we could double the Southern Cape of this
Iſland, by reaſon of the contrary Winds. It was
then that Diſtempers began to reign among our
Ships Crew, two thirds of them being diſabled
by the Scurvy; this is that ſo much dreaded Sea-plague,
which the <hi>French</hi> Sea-Men call the Evil
of the Land, becauſe it is from thence alone they
expect the cure of this dreadful Diſtemper. There
were very few of the whole Ships Crew, who
had not their ſhare of it, and this joyned with
the continual fatigues, occaſioned by the fury of
contrary Winds, put us almoſt in deſpair, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bereaved of all hopes of reaching the Shoar,
if Providence had not delivered us again by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
For the Wind wheeling about, all upon a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57955:19"/>
ſudden, we came 3 Weeks after we had firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Shoar of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> in ſight of the
Iſle of <hi>Burbon,</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Maſcareigne,</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not loſt above 3 of our whole Crew, yet
we were 4 days longer before we could reach the
Shoar, where we caſt our Anchors, directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to one of the <hi>French</hi> Plantations, called St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> Situate on the Weſt-ſide of the Iſland; the
firſt thing we had to do was to take care of our
Sick Men, who were brought on Shoar, where
we loſt 2 more of our Men, one being Drowned,
and the other expiring ſo ſoon as he was ſet on
Shoar.</p>

                        <p>It cannot be denied, but that ſome of the <hi>French,</hi>
by their manner of living, ſhew'd but a very ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to theſe new Converts; for ſome of them
live ſo ſcandalous a life, that they were forbid the
uſe of the Sacrament, and to ſtand only in the
Church porch, during Divine Service. But this
Penance which was intended as a proper remedy to
correct their Libertiniſm, had almoſt proved the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of a Schiſm; for theſe Libertines having met
with a Prieſt of their own Kidney, they ſet up a
Chapel for their own uſe, where they exerciſed
Divine Worſhip in ſpite of the Commands of their
Superiours to the Contrary, till at laſt the ſaid Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
was ordered to be burnt.</p>
                        <p>Among ſome of the <hi>Madagaſcarians</hi> they obſerve
not any Rules in their Marriages,<note place="margin">Their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> they copulate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without the leaſt Engagement or promiſe on
either ſide, and leave one another as freely again as
they met at firſt. The quite contrary is practiſed
in the Countries of <hi>Galamboule</hi> and <hi>Antongil,</hi> where
they are ſo far from being common, that they keep
the Women very cloſe, and if they are convicted of
Adultery, they are puniſh'd with Death. In other
places where they are more Barbarous, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt regard to the nearneſs of Blood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the moſt abominable inceſts at pleaſure.</p>

I will not determine here, whether the Women
of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> are ſubject to the ſame pains as our
<hi>European</hi> Women in Child-bed; but thus much is
certain, that no ſooner are they delivered, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Child upon a Mat, they go ſtraight-ways
to the next River to Waſh themſelves, neither take
they any further care of the Child, but only to give
it now and then the Teat.</p>
                        <p>They have certain days which they ſolemnize
with Dancing to certain Inſtruments, made after
their way, beſides which they eat at an exceſſive
rate. Their Songs are not compoſed to any certain
Tune, as it is Cuſtomary among other Nations,
but every one Sings as he pleaſes; one Voice begins,
the reſt follow and make up a Chorus as well as they
can, endeavouring to make their Geſticulations
bear ſome proportion to their Song and ſmall Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels;
all which together, makes a confuſed, but
ſometimes not ſo very diſagreeable a Noiſe.</p>

In their Feaſts they obſerve the following method;
in the middle of the Aſſembly, which lie all
round about upon the Ground, they ſet a good
quantity of boiled Rice; then they lay a whole Ox,
(or ſometimes two or three, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Gueſts) extended upon his Hide, which
ſerves inſtead of a Diſh; every one cuts a good
piece for himſelf where he pleaſes, which having
put upon a Wooden Stick, he holds it a little to the
Fire, and ſo devours it before it be half roaſted.</p>
                        <p>There is good ſtore of Grapes in this Iſland, but
they make ſeldom any Wine of them; nay, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>
will ſcarce touch them to eat; for before the
<hi>French</hi> came into the Iſle, they look'd upon them as
Poiſon. They make their Drink out of Honey,
which they call <hi>Tenteb,</hi> and their Wine <hi>Chictenteb,</hi>
which ſignifies as much as Honey Wine,<note place="margin">Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</note> or as we
call it, <hi>Hydromel:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> rarely uſe any other,
and prefer it before Wine.</p>
                        <p>In each Village there is a large publick Hall, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
on all ſides, covered only on the Roof, where
they put upon any Solemn occaſion, a great Veſſel

Ships come to an Anchor, as being ſheltred againſt
the Winds from all ſides. The South and Eaſt
Winds are moſt favourable to further the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

hand, they are directly oppoſite to thoſe who
are to come out; ſo that theſe Winds being very
frequent here, you may enter without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in a few Hours, but it will require often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſome Months before you can get out again.
They are as much peſtered here with continual

is the Air much better; the people hereabouts
Live like the reſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Madagaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car;</hi>

take on Board; and the next day after we ſet
Sail from the Iſland, we came to an Anchor in the
Road of <hi>Galamboule,</hi> where there is always a high
Sea, let the Weather be never ſo fair. After we
had Embark'd all the <hi>French</hi> that were to go along
with us, we blew up the Fort, at the ſight of

Mountainers, their irreconcilable Enemies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

outcries, and gave us all the poſſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their utmoſt Deſpair. Their miſerable
Condition moving us to Compaſſion, we took as
many of them as our Ship would hold, on Board

continu'd his Courſe all the Night, ſo that
at break of Day, beſide the danger we had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,

we found our ſelves a great way below the Bay.
The worſt of all was, that being encouraged by
the hopes of a ſpeedy Paſſage, we had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
our Proviſions to the beſt Advantage, ſo
that having nothing left, but a ſmall quantity of
Rice, we began to conſult what was moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

it was at laſt reſolved to approach the Shoar, and
to Land all thoſe whom we had brought along
with us from St. <hi>Mary's</hi> and <hi>Galamboule.</hi> Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to this Reſolution, we came to an Anchor in
the Bay of <hi>Galleons,</hi> which received its Name from
ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Galleons that were loſt near this
place. This Bay being not above 3 Leagues from
Fort <hi>Dauphine,</hi> we only ſtay'd for Day-light, that
we might with the more conveniency diſembark
our Men; where on a ſudden, a freſh Gale ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

                        <p>THE City is Situate under the one and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Degree of North Latitude, and is one of
the moſt conſiderable Ports in the Empire of the
<hi>Great Mogul.</hi> It is very large and populous, Built
upon the Banks of a fair River, which runs under
its Walls, and about 3 Leagues from thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embogues
into the Sea. When I Arrived near the
City, the Gates were not ſhut up; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were obliged for their Security to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Prince called <hi>Sevagi,</hi> who by his frequent
Incurſions has cauſed them to ſurround their City
with a good Wall, and to be conſtantly upon
their Guard. The Sand Banks which are at the
Entrance of this River, are very uncertain, being
by the violence of the Current frequently tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from one place to another, ſo that they are
rarely to be met withal two Years together in the
ſame place, which renders the paſſage of Ships both
very troubleſome and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The Streets of <hi>Suratte</hi> are handſome enough,
but they have this inconvenience,<note place="margin">Streets of <hi>Suratte.</hi>
                           </note> that they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

call their Summer, tho' all the time the Sun is at
the greateſt diſtance from them. To remedy this,
they continually water the Streets, eſpecially in

Walks, made with a certain ſort of Plaſter; which
appears as beautiful as White Marble, and keeps
out the Rain, they have only a little riſing in the
middle, for the better convenience of conveying
the Water into the Streets; abundance of people
paſs whole Nights upon theſe Terraces, to enjoy
the benefit of the cool Air.</p>
                        <p>All Houſes of people of any Faſhion, have their
Gardens ſurrounded with fine Arbours,<note place="margin">Their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> bearing
Grapes twice a Year. Beſides which, they have
great ſtore of all ſorts of Flowers, but eſpecially
thoſe they call <hi>Mougrin,</hi> which being not unlike
our <hi>Jaſſamin</hi> Flowers, are in great requeſt among
the <hi>Indians.</hi> They have alſo certain Trees bearing
Flowers, which open at Sun-Riſing, and fall off
at Sun-Set; and others of which the Flowers open
at Sun-Set, and decay at Sun-riſing; and the whole
Year being but one continued Spring Seaſon in this
Climate, furniſhes them always with all ſorts of
Fruits and Flowers.</p>
                        <p>People of Quality, nay, even thoſe of an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Rank, have their Bathing places, which being
made all of Stone, are extreamly neat. They
make uſe of them partly upon the account of their
Religion, partly to allay the violence of the heat
of the Climate.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> Inhabit the beſt

                        <p>ABout a quarter of a League from <hi>Suratte,</hi> there
is a great <hi>Tancke</hi> or Ciſtern, made of Free-Stone.
It was Built by a Rich <hi>Banjan,</hi> and is of
a great Circumference; you go into it by a fair
pair of Stairs, and in the middle you ſee a little
Temple Conſecrated to their Gods, unto whom,
they offer their Prayers, after they have Bathed
themſelves. The Walks leading to it are very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Planted with Trees, and are look'd upon as the
moſt pleaſant of the whole Country. There are
alſo about <hi>Suratte,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Publick Gardens.</note> publick Gardens, which being
very neatly kept, want nothing that may recreate
the Eye, and are of free acceſs for every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Banjans</hi> Inhabiting <hi>Suratte,</hi> are indeed the
Richeſt, and have the chief management of the
Traffick throughout the <hi>Indies;</hi> nevertheleſs, the
<hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Mahometans</hi> live in much more ſplendor.
If a perſon of Quality happens to paſs through the
City, upon any Solemn occaſion, he has his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
before him, which being 8 or 10 Foot long,
and proportionable in bigneſs, make a pleaſant and
Warlike Harmony.</p>
                        <p>After the Example of theſe, Foreigners who bear
any conſiderable Office have the Arms of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57955:36"/>
Princes or Common-wealths, whom they ſerve,
carried before them, and have likewiſe their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
which attend them where ever they go.</p>
                        <p>At about a League diſtant from the City, there
is a Village which is inhabited only by <hi>Perſians</hi> or
<hi>Parſis,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">A Village inhabited by <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                           </note> who adore the Sun and Fire; hither the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Suratte</hi> come frequently to drink Palm-Wine,
which they call <hi>Tary.</hi> It is a moſt delicious
ſort of Liquor; how it is made, I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the end of <hi>September,</hi> when the rainy Seaſon

                        </p>
                        <p>The Air of <hi>Suratte</hi> is very good; it is never cold
here, and the heats are pretty tolerable.</p>
                        <p>The Port of <hi>Sovaly</hi> is about four Leagues to the
<hi>North-Weſt,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Harbour of <hi>Suratte.</hi>
                           </note> this is the place where all Foreign Ships

longer than from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>May,</hi> the reſt of the
Year being very dangerous for Ships, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the frequent Tempeſts and changeableneſs of
the Winds. There are a great many fair Villages
round the Harbours, among which <hi>Sovaly</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
its Name to the Port, is the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
Here moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Companies
have their Ware-houſes and Offices, which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
with the Arms of their Principals to whom
they belong. The <hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Subjects are not
permitted to enter the Port or <hi>Sovaly,</hi> for fear they
ſhould defraud him of the Cuſtoms, none but the
<hi>Europeans</hi> enjoy this Privilege. Theſe draw to this
Village great number of <hi>Banjans, Moors</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who during the time, that the <hi>European</hi> Veſſels
tarry in this Port, ſet up their Booths, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put in good order, and divided into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Streets, make up a kind of a moveable Village,
where they ſell every thing, which may be uſeful
to the Foreign Mariners. There hapned ſome
years before my arrival, an unlucky accident to a
<hi>Frenchman</hi> in this Port, which had been likely to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57955:37"/>
have proved of very ill conſequence. A <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
came on board a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel to cheapen ſome
things, and amongſt the reſt, asked them, whether
they had any Piſtols to ſell? Several pair having
been ſhew'd him, he went to diſcharge one of them
out of a Window in the Cabin, but he, who was
the Seller, finding him very unexpert in handling
of Fire-arms, took one and diſcharged it himſelf;
but the Piſtol being charged with three Bullets, he
unfortunately ſhot a young Child which was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſhoar, through the Breaſt, of which it died
inſtantly. The news of this unfortunate accident
was ſoon ſpread, not only through the Village, but
in <hi>Suratte</hi> it ſelf, where the Rabble began to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous,
and to declare publickly, that they would
not reſt ſatisfied, till they had Sacrificed all the <hi>French</hi>
in <hi>Suratte,</hi> and had revenged the Death of the Child
upon a Nation, who made killing and ſlaying their
Paſs-time; ſo that for ſeveral days together, no
<hi>Frenchman</hi> durſt ſtir out of the Doors. At laſt, the
Perſon, who by his careleſsneſs had been the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this unfortunate accident, having by ſome of
his Friends convinced them of his innocence, the
matter was accommodated, and the Tumult ceaſed.
For it hapned, that the Child that was killed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to <hi>Pagan</hi> Parents, ſo that they were appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the means of a Sum of Money, under condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the who had committed the Fact, ſhould
not be permitted to come aſhoar, but to return into
<hi>Europe,</hi> by the ſame Veſſel that had brought him
thither. If this Child had been a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> he
would not have come off at ſo eaſie a rate, but
would have been in no ſmall danger of his Life, it
being an indiſpenſable Law, and always religiouſly
obſerved among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that if a Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but eſpecially a Chriſtian, kills a <hi>Muſulman</hi>
(a name which all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> aſſume, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much as a true Believer) he muſt expiate
the crime by his Death.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Indian</hi> Hiſtories affirm, That in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
theſe Countries being Governed by <hi>Pagan</hi>
Princes, the Women often grown weary of their
Husbands, made a common practice of ridding their
hands of them by Poiſon.<note place="margin">How this Cuſtom was introduced.</note> The many tragical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of this Nature, did oblige at laſt thoſe Princes
who were not always exempt from the cruel deſigns
of the Women, to make a Law, that all Women of
what Age and Quality ſoever, ſhould be burnt with
the dead Carcaſſes of their Husbands. To give the
better colour to this cruel Decree, it was back'd by
the ſpecious pretext of Religion, promiſing a large
ſhare of Enjoyment to thoſe unfortunate Creatures,
in the other World. Beſides, that the <hi>Bramans</hi> paid
them very near the ſame reverence as to their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by which vain glory the crafty Prieſts having
gained upon the Weakneſs of their Sex, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
choſe to make a vertue of neceſſity, and by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57955:40"/>
a voluntary Act, to render their Deaths more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                        <p>Many Ages after the <hi>Mahometans</hi> being become
Maſters of the greateſt part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> were for
aboliſhing this dreadful Cuſtom of forcing People to
be their own Executioners; for which reaſon it was
ordained, that none ſhould be conſtrained to
Sacrifice themſelves at their Husbands Funerals, but
that they ſhould be left to their liberty, either to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
or die with them.</p>
                        <p>The Governours are in Perſon to examine ſuch of
the <hi>Pagan</hi> Women as offer themſelves to be Burnt;
they are to endeavour by all fair means and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to divert them from their deſigns, and if they
perſiſt in their Reſolution, they are obliged to give
their conſent, but withall to keep them under a
ſtrict Guard, for fear, that if they ſhould happen
to change their mind, they may not be reſcued out
of their hands. They look upon this as a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
precaution, the better to oblige them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
ſeriouſly upon what they undertake, before
they enter upon ſo fatal a Reſolution; for there have
not been wanting inſtances of thoſe, who at firſt
courted and demanded Death from the Governours
with an undaunted Courage, who have been ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and trembled at the ſight of the Funeral Pile,
and too late repented themſelves of their raſh Vows.</p>
                        <p>The Ceremony is performed in the following
manner:<note place="margin">How the Ceremony is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The Corps of the deceaſed Husband is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the place where it is to be conſumed by Fire,
the Inhabitants of <hi>Surat</hi> perform it commonly at a

certain place, called <hi>Soulpara,</hi> where there is one of
the moſt famous Temples of the whole Province,
it being their Cuſtom upon ſuch an occaſion, to be as
near a Temple and the Water as they can; then
the Widow is brought thither in Triumph on Horſe
Back, moſt magnificently attired with a Garland of
Flowers about her Head; ſhe is ſurrounded by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
that play upon Muſical Inſtruments, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by her Kindred and Friends, who Dance and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57955:40"/>
Sing for joy, to have ſuch a Heroine in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

they are carried by Water; when the dead
Corps is laid in the Boat, ſo as that the Widow,
who is ſeated upon a Chair, may ſet her Feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
                        <p>Being arrived at the place, the dead Corps is laid
upon the Bank of the River, where the Widow
waſhes it; which done, it is carried into a little
Hut of ſeven or eight foot ſquare, made for that
purpoſe of very dry Wood, covered with Reed,
dip'd in Oil, Roſin and Brimſtone, to render it the
more Combuſtible; it has a little Door through
which the dead Body being conveyed into the place,
the Widow comes out of the Water, and thus wet,
takes ſeveral rounds about the Funeral Pile, which
done, ſhe embraces her Children, if ſhe have any,
and the reſt of her Kindred or Friends there preſent,
among whom having diſtributed what precious
moveables ſhe has about her, they are removed at a
further diſtance, for fear their Tears ſhould diſturb
her.<note place="margin">How they burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> Thus prepared ſhe enters the fatal place,
where ſhe is to ſacrifice her ſelf, and being ſeated
upon a heap of Straw, mix'd with Brimſtone, near
the dead Carcaſs of her Husband, a <hi>Braman</hi> exhorts
her to conſtancy, comforting her with the hopes of
being ſoon reunited with her own better half; then
he gives her a Torch in one hand, and ſome leaves
of a Book in which he has been reading before in
the other, if her heart don't fail her, ſhe ſets the Pile
on fire her ſelf, but if ſhe be not courageous enough
to do it, the <hi>Braman</hi> after being come out, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the door behind him, does her this laſt office,
whilſt the Spectators ſing certain Songs to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Praiſe of the Lady, who thus happily has
made her ſelf a Sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>The firſt time that I was an Eye-witneſs of this
Tragical Ceremony, I took moſt particular notice
of all Paſſages and Circumſtances that attend it; ſhe
that ſacrificed her ſelf, did not appear to be above
twenty Years of Age; ſhe look'd upon her Funeral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           </gap>ate;
ſhe with her own hands ſet fire to the combuſtible
matter that ſurrounded her; I was very near the
Pile, ſo that I could exactly ſee her lift up her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Husband's Head, and preſs her Cheeks to his,
which done, ſhe pulled her Veil over her Face,
and died without the leaſt appearance of regret.</p>
                        <p>Some time after, I ſaw ſuch another Spectacle.
She that was to be ſacrificed, was not quite ſo young
as the former, and had preſs'd the Execution of her
Vow with a great deal of Reſolution, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
began to fail her at that very time when ſhe
ſtood moſt in need of it; for, ſcarce was ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
within the Funeral Pile, but ſhe ſtrove by all
means poſſible to get out, but the <hi>Braman</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſet fire to the Combuſtible Materials, and thus
forced her to undergo that cruel fate, which ſhe had
ſought for with ſo much eagerneſs. So ſoon as the
Bodies are conſumed by the Fire, their Aſhes are
thrown into the next River, and the Families of
thoſe Women who thus have ſacrificed themſelves,
are in great eſteem ever after among the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In thoſe places where the <hi>Pagans</hi> are abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
this Law is put in Execution with the utmoſt
ſeverity, the Women that don't voluntarily offer
themſelves to be ſacrificed, being conſtrained by
force, to ſatisfie the cruel Law of their Native
Country.</p>
                        <p>But what is the moſt ſurpriſing of all, is, That
ſometimes Men very far advanced in Years, marry
young Creatures of ſeven or eight years of Age, and
theſe notwithſtanding the innocence and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Age, are forced to conform themſelves
to the barbarous cuſtom of their Country, if their
Husbands die before them.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome Kingdoms in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where
theſe Sacrifices are performed in a different manner.
They dig a deep hole in the Ground, wherein they lay
the dead Corps; they make a great Fire round about
it, for three days conſecutively; the Widow is led
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57955:41"/>
round about it, covered with a certain Veil, made
out of the Leaves of the <hi>Banana</hi>-Tree, and after
having taken her turns and bid farewell to all her
Friends, She throws her ſelf into the Fire, where
She is conſumed to Aſhes.</p>
                        <p>Others dig a Grave,<note place="margin">Several ways of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing themſelves.</note> wherein they Bury the
Dead Carcaſs of the Husband, and the Widow
being laid a-top of him, they throw ſo much Earth
upon them as covers her Body quite up to the
Neck; then the <hi>Braman</hi> approaches, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
imparted to the poor Victim his Conſolations
and Bleſſing, he Strangles her, and then covers
them all over with Earth.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Maudre</hi> has ſeldom leſs than 3 or

17th Degree of North Latitude, on the Coaſt of
<hi>Malabar,</hi> about 20 Leagues North from <hi>Goa;</hi> and
you come to it by a River, which runs with a very
gentle Current. Near the Mouth of it on the right
ſide of the Shoar, you ſee a ſmall Village, Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
only by Fiſher-Men, and 4 Leagues beyond it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57955:44"/>
is the City of <hi>Rajapour,</hi> which has Communicated
its Name to the ſaid River. You may go up with
a Veſſel of 100 Tuns, as far as to a ſmall Iſland,
which is about half way betwixt the City and the
Mouth of the River; afterwards you make uſe of
<hi>Chaloups</hi> and Barges, to carry the Merchandice

at low Water it is fordable in ſome places.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had here formerly a Factory, but

we ſaw come into the Room a Band of Women
Dancers, which he had ordred to appear there for our

but their Geſtures are not very modeſt, they
are generally well ſhaped, and appear very ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

us, by reaſon of the Novelty of the Spectacle; but
we were extreamly fatigued by the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

broke our faſt before we came out, ſo that we had
much rather had a more ſubſtantial Entertainment,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57955:45"/>
than that, which only ſerved to divert our Eyes,
and all this time was not ſo entertaining to us, as a

There was ſerved up variety of moſt excellent

                        <p>WHen we ſpeak of the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> we

this being the place, where the People begin
to aſſume the Name of <hi>Malabars</hi> or <hi>Malavars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its extent all along the Coaſt is of above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                        </p>
                        <p>The Air is very good all over the Country,
which is one of the moſt fertile in all <hi>Aſia;</hi> they
reap Rice twice a Year, and have good ſtore of moſt

                        </p>

Though it be evident that the <hi>Cocoe</hi> is none of the
moſt delicious Fruit of the <hi>Indies,</hi> nevertheleſs its
uſefulneſs being ſo univerſal, it deſerves to be
mentioned here, and we will inſert a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Deſcription of the Tree that bears ſo uſeful a
Fruit.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Malabars</hi> call it <hi>Tencar,</hi> which ſignifies as
much as ſtraight, as having no Branches, though the
Tree it ſelf be ſometimes thirty or forty foot high,
ſeldom exceeding three foot in compaſs. The
Wood is ſpongy, and conſequently uſeleſs for Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
unleſs it be when it grows very old, when it
becomes much more ſolid.<note place="margin">Cocoe-Tree deſcribed.</note> The roots of it are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſpreading almoſt above ground, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, the Tree out-braves the utmoſt fury of
Winds, it being very rare to ſee them t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rn up even
by the moſt violent Hurricanes. Towards the top
there ſprouts out about a douzen leaves of ten foot
long each, and one and an half broad, being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the middle like thoſe of the Date-tree; when
they are dryed, they ſerve inſtead of Tiles to cover
Houſes withall; out of their fineſt Threads they
make very fine Mats. Tents and Huts of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
Branches. The middle part of the leaf ſerves for
Fuel. Their number is always the ſame; for ſo ſoon
as one falls, another grows in its ſtead. On the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
top of the Tree there ſprouts out a very large
Bud, not unlike a Cabbage or Cawly-flower, but
much larger and finer than ours, enough to ſerve
ten People for a Meal; but, becauſe the Tree dies
ſoon after the Fruit is gathered, they commonly cut
down the Tree near the Root, when they intend
to make uſe of it. Betwixt the top and the leaves
come forth abundance of young Sprigs, about the
thickneſs of a Man's Arm; theſe they cut, from
whence deſtills a Liquor of a white Colour,
and a ſweet and delicious taſte, which the <hi>Tieves</hi>
(ſuch among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> as apply themſelves to
Husbandry) come to gather Mornings and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in certain Veſſels faſtned to the end of the Sprigs,<note place="margin">Palm-Tree Wine.</note>
from whence flows the ſaid Liquor.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57955:47"/>
This is the Wine of the Country, called by them
<hi>Houry,</hi> or <hi>Tary;</hi> it is ſo ſtrong as to inebriate a Man
like our Wines;<note place="margin">Vinegar and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> in few hours it contracts a
ſharpneſs, and in one Day and Night turns quite
Sowre, when it is uſed inſtead of Vinegar, they
having no other throughout the <hi>Indies.</hi> They alſo
make of it a kind of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> or Brandy, which
by repeated Deſtillations becomes exceſſive ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>If you put this Liquor as ſoon as it is drawn from
the Quick-tree, into a Baſin with a ſmall quantity
of Lime, it becomes as ſweet as Honey, which
they make uſe of for Preſerves, and if it be boiled
for ſome time, it becomes Sugar, not quite ſo good
as that which is drawn from Canes, but which is
nevertherleſs much uſed among the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Malabar;</hi> the Natives call it <hi>Jagara,</hi> and the
<hi>Portugueſe Jagre.</hi> As long as the <hi>Tary</hi> deſtills out of
the Sprigs, the Tree bears no Fruit, but if you let
them grow, there come forth great Bunches, which
produce the <hi>Cocoes</hi> hanging in Cluſters, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ten or twelve.</p>
                        <p>Their skin is very tender at firſt,<note place="margin">Cocoes.</note> and eaſie to be
ſlit, from whence flows a very clear and freſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
of a very agreeable taſte; ſome of them will
afford not much above a pint of Liquor, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
give near a Gallon.</p>
                        <p>This Liquor is by degrees converted into a ſolid
ſubſtance, which is very ſoft and white, and then
the <hi>Malabars</hi> call the <hi>Cocoes Elenir,</hi> and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe
Lagne.</hi> Afterwards the moiſture being all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
the Fruit becomes hard, and its taſte is not
unlike our Haſle Nuts. They are ſo well known
in thoſe parts, that it would be ſuperfluous to give
a particular account here, to what uſe they are put
in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince they are brought thither from all
parts in ſo great quantities, that they are no more
look'd upon now a days as a rarity, but are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meerly for their Natural and intrinſick good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>The Tree brings forth Fruit three times a year;
ſome are as big as a Man's Head, and becauſe they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57955:48"/>
are beaten down by the leaſt Wind, it is dangerous
to walk under theſe Trees when the Fruit is come to
perfection.</p>
                        <p>They make out of the outward Husk, when dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a kind of Hemp, the threads of which ſerve to
make ſtrong Cordage and Cables, for the biggeſt
Ships; and as there is a prodigious quantity of this
Fruit all over the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſo beſides what is conſum'd
by the Natives, and what is exported by Foreigners;
they burn abundance of it, to make Charcoals for
the uſe of the Goldſmiths and others.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Cooks ſeaſon their Meats with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Liquor which they get out of the <hi>Cocoes</hi> by ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
it, and the poorer ſort extract an Oyl of it,
which they both Eat and Burn in their Lamps.
They fatten their Poultry and Hogs with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
out of which the Oil has been preſſed, and ſo
the poor ſometimes make Bread of it.<note place="margin">Indian <hi>Paper.</hi>
                           </note> The Pith
of the Tree is White, and as fine as any Paper, for
which uſe it is much ſought after by perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                        <p>Conſidering the extraordinary benefit reap'd from
this Tree, he may well be look'd upon as one of the
moſt precious in the Univerſe, though he be none
of the rareſt. What has been related by ſome, to wit,
That they make Ships that croſs the Seas without
any thing but what the <hi>Cocoe</hi> affords, though it ſeems
to ſavour of a Romance, is nevertheleſs thus far true;
that they may equip a good large Barge with Maſts,
Sails, (which are made out of the leaves) and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
loaden with the products of the Tree and Fruits
of the <hi>Cocoes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are beſides this two other kinds of Palm-trees;
the firſt bears that ſort of Dates, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to maturity in the <hi>Indies;</hi> the Tree is not
above eight or ten foot high, without Branches, and
bears its leaves on the top, much like the <hi>Cocoe-tree,</hi>
but they are not near ſo large. They bore a hole
in the Arm of the Tree, from whence by the help
of a Pipe, they draw a certain Liquor not unlike
the <hi>Tary,</hi> we have mention'd before. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57955:48"/>
call it <hi>Nary,</hi> and it ſerves them to make Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
of and <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> but no Sugar.</p>
                        <p>The other kind is the Wild Palm-tree;<note place="margin">Two other ſorts of <hi>Palm-Trees.</hi>

one of them is ſometimes a good Burthen for

in Bulk. Its leaves are not unlike to the
Laurel, but ſomething larger: The Fruit is faſtned
to the Stemm, becauſe the Branches are not ſtrong
enough to bear it; it buds out at firſt ſight moſt
like Moſs, is of a green Colour, till it comes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity;
its Skin is moſt like that of the <hi>Anana's;</hi> it
is pretty thick but ſoft, and may eaſily be cut with
a Knife, provided you dip it firſt in Oil, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oleaginous ſubſtance, which prevents the
Gumm from ſticking to it. The Fruit is divided
within by many partitions, containing a certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
not unlike our Plums, and of the bigneſs of an
ordinary Pullet's Egg; there are ſometimes two
hundred of them, the Pulp that ſurrounds it, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an inch thick, of a Yellow Colour, and taſtes

                        <p>THE Shrub which bears the Pepper is always
planted near other great Trees, which keep
it upright; its leaves are very like the Ivy, whoſe
ſmell is as biting to the Noſtrils, as the Fruit is to
the Tongue. The Pepper ſprouts forth in ſmall
Bunches; its colour is Green at firſt, but turns Red
when it comes to Maturity, and after it has been
dry'd in the Sun, appears ſuch as we ſee it in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
There is but one kind, the difference betwixt
the Black and White (according to the opinion of
the vulgar) being nothing elſe, but that the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57955:49"/>
its native husk, whereas the other is peeled,
which they do by thraſhing it with ſmall ſticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be quite dry, or after it is dryed, by ſoaking
it for a little while in Water, and then rub off the
outward peel; by which means, every body that has
black Pepper, may ſoon convert it into White, if
he will take the trouble to do it.</p>

Ground produces a vaſt yearly revenue to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
They need neither Sow nor Plant it, all the

They whiten them without the leaſt prejudice to

                        <p>The Chaw being thus prepared, fortifies the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,

no body is oblig'd to take it upon the ſpot,
the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> in general being very jealous of one
another, and extreamly fearful of Poyſon.</p>
                        <p>There is a certain Tree all over the <hi>Indies,</hi> but
more eſpecially in <hi>Malabar,</hi> which grows to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
height, its Leaves are like thoſe of the
Laurel, or at leaſt very little different; it bears a
whitiſh Flower of a very good ſcent; out of the
Stem diſtills a Gum, which is very uſeful for Ships;
but what is particularly remarkable in this Tree,
is, that its Branches after they are grown up to
ſome height, turn downwards again to the Ground,
where as ſoon as they touch they take root, and
in proceſs of time, grow equal in bulk to the firſt
Stem. If the Inhabitants did not prevent the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Tree by continually cutting down its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
one Tree would in time be ſufficient to ſpread
it ſelf all over the Country.</p>

                           <hi>Malabar</hi> abounds in almoſt all the ſame ſorts of
Pulſe we have in theſe parts, beſides which, it has
ſome peculiar to it ſelf; among theſe are certain
Beans of four Fingers long,<note place="margin">Large Peans.</note> the Cod containing in
length a foot and half. They come very quickly
to maturity, are of no good taſte, and only uſed by
the poorer ſort. They are never ſeen in Gardens,
unleſs it be to cover and ſhadow their Arbours or
Summer-Houſes.</p>
                        <p>Beſides which, they have on both ſides of their
Walks, Hedge-rows of a certain Shrub, which ſpreads
and twiſts it ſelf in a little time to admiration;
it is very full of Leaves, reſembling thoſe of the
Garden Burnet, and bears a great quantity of
Flowers, of a right Red Colour, not unlike the Jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Flowers, but having not the leaſt ſcent, ſerve
only to pleaſe the Eye. They begin to blow at
Sun-riſing, and fall off at Sun-ſet. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which, theſe Hedges never want Flowers the
whole Year round, without the trouble of Sowing
or Planting them after the firſt time, becauſe they
ſcatter certain Grains upon the Ground, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
taking root, furniſh the Hedge with an
immediate ſupply of new Shrubs and Flowers.
The <hi>Malabars</hi> are not ſuch great admirers of Flowers
as the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are ſubject to the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi>
and tho' their Country is not deſtitute of theſe
materials, from whence they draw their eſſences
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet their Women ſeldom make uſe
of any thing elſe than the Oil drawn from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,
they not being inclined ſo much to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of perfumes, as the reſt of the <hi>Indian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                        <p>THE Birds which are found in <hi>Malabar,</hi> are the
ſame which you meet with in other parts of
the <hi>Indies.</hi> Perroquets or Perrots, of all ſizes and
Colours, are here in great numbers; they catch
them with Nets, ſometimes 200 at a time, but
the <hi>Indians</hi> never take any pains to teach them to
Speak, as we do in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They do abound in all ſorts of Wild fowl, which
they take with a great deal of eaſe, unleſs it be
the Wild-Peacock, which is very difficult to be
catch'd, which makes him to be look'd upon as a
rarity, not only for the Tail, but alſo for his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which are in great eſteem among all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaticks;</hi>
they make Umbrella's, Shrines, and Fans
of them, for perſons of Quality, which they adorn
with Gold, and Precious Stones. They have alſo
good ſtore of Tame-Fowl.</p>
                        <p>The Elephant ought to hold the firſt rank among
the Beaſts which are to be found on the Coaſt of
<hi>Malabar,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Elephant.</note> tho' it be brought thither from other
parts of the <hi>Indies.</hi> It is the biggeſt among all the
Terreſtrial Creatures, the Head is not proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in bigneſs to the Body, its Ears are in ſhape
not unlike to the Wings of a Flitter-Mouſe; Its
Legs round and thick, and of an equal bigneſs,
but is not deſtitute of Joynts. He makes uſe of his
Snout to take hold of any thing that is offered him,
this he can draw in or extend at pleaſure, and
where-ever he lays hold with it, no Man alive is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57955:52"/>
able to wreſt it from him againſt his will; he will
handle a Cimetar with the ſame dexterity as if he
had the uſe of Hands; this Trunk or Snout, is
hollow within, ſo that when the Elephant drinks,
he draws the Water through it into his Mouth.
I have ſeen them returning from the River ſide,
when ſome of them had kept in their Trunks near
a Pailful of Water, which they would ſpout into
the Faces of ſuch perſons as they bore a grudge
to; no Creature alive is more intelligible, nor has
a greater memory than the Elephant, of which
I have been ſufficiently convinced, upon ſeveral
occaſions.</p>
                        <p>Each City in the <hi>Indies</hi> entertains a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of young Fellows, who's Buſineſs it is to ſweep
their Houſes and Streets. A Boy of about 12 or
13 Years of Age, who belonged to thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this drudgery in the City of <hi>Suratte,</hi> having
ſwept together ſome excrements, and ſeeing an
Elephant coming that way, took up as many of
them as he could hold in both his Hands, and
threw it directly at the Elephant's Eyes, who went
on his way without ſhowing the leaſt ſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.
But ſeveral days after, meeting the
ſame Boy in a narrow Street, he took hold of him
with his Trunk round the Waſte, and ſo toſt him
above 100 times at a great heighth in the Air, to
the no ſmall ſurprize of all that beheld it; I
did not imagine otherwiſe, but that it would have
coſt the Boy his Life; but after ſome time we
were agreeably ſurprized to find that the Elephant
only intended to put him into a fright, in retal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
for the Affront he had received from him
ſome days before; for, after he had thus ſported
with him, as long as he thought convenient, he laid
him gently again in the ſame place where he had
taken him up, and without more ado went his
way.</p>
                        <p>A certain <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Vice-Roy, had an Elephant
of an extraordinary Bigneſs, which he being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to Preſent to the King, he ordered he ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57955:52"/>
be Embark'd in the firſt Veſſel, that was to go for
<hi>Lisbon.</hi> He that had the overſight of the Elephant,
being unwilling to leave his Native Country, uſed
in the mean while to tell the Elephant in the ſame
terms as one ſhould ſpeak to a Man, That they
were going to Tranſport him into a Country where
he muſt expect to undergo all the Slavery and
Hardſhip that could be imagined; which had
made ſuch a lively impreſſion upon the Elephant,
that all the Art of Mankind, could not get him
into the Veſſel, which was to Tranſport him, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
having loſt their Lives by his fury, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to force him into the Ship; the Vice-Roy
being advertized of what had paſſed, and not
doubting but that this Trick had been put upon
him by the Manager of the Elephant, had him
brought into his preſence, and threatned him with
Death, if within a limited time, he did not take
care to have the Elephant conveyed into the Ship;
the Fellow dreading the Vice-Roy's Anger, was
obliged to change his Leſſon, and to tell the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
that he was to be Preſented to a great Prince,
where he was to lead a very eaſie Life, which had
ſuch an influence upon this Creature, that they
afterwards Embark'd him without the leaſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                        <p>There is ſcarce any Perſon of Quality in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

going into the Country for their divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon the Back of an Elephant, where they
had fixed very large and Magnificent Tents, divided
into 2 or 3 Apartments, to wit, one for the Men,
and the other for the Women, and the third for
a Table provided with variety of eatables.</p>
                        <p>They adorn them with fine Coverings, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in faſhion to our Horſe-Cloaths; I have ſeen
ſome of them which took up no leſs than 100
Yards of Cloath apiece; and yet theſe were made
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57955:53"/>
for Elephants that are not of the biggeſt ſize; for, I
can affirm it for Truth, becauſe I have been an eye
witneſs of it, that there are ſome much larger;
which may be eaſily diſcovered by their Teeth.
For thoſe of the Elephants on the Coaſt of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
ſeldom exceed 3 or 4 Foot in length, and
may be carried without much difficulty by one
Man;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Elephant</hi>'s Teeth.</note> whereas the Elephant's Teeth of <hi>Bombaza</hi>
and <hi>Moſambigue,</hi> two places in <hi>Africa,</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above 10 Foot long, and of ſuch a bigneſs,
that two Men can ſcarce lift them from the
Ground.</p>
                        <p>Abundance of theſe Teeth are brought to the

them, which furniſh us as well as other parts of
the World with what we call Ivory.</p>
                        <p>After I had by my own Experience been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
inſtructed concerning the nature of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,

                           </note>
how they could never lie down, and if by miſchance
he happened to fall, he could never riſe again;
that when he takes his natural reſt, he leans againſt
a Tree, and that the only way to catch him is to
ſaw the Trunk of the Tree, which he is obſerved
to make his Sleeping-place, that ſo he may fall
down together with the Tree; but theſe are meer
Inventions of thoſe who Travel no farther than
within the compaſs of their own homes; for, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has been in any part of <hi>Aſia</hi> muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The Elephant lies down without any great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he bends his Knee as often as his Maſter mounts
on the Back of him, and Sleeps in the ſame poſture
as a Horſe.</p>
                        <p>They catch him in the following manner:<note place="margin">How he is catch'd.</note> when
they know the way he commonly takes, they dig
a hole or ditch, which they cover ſlightly with
Branches, with ſome Earth a-top of it, where the
Elephant is drawn into the Snare; for the bulk of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57955:53"/>
his Body being ſuch, as to prevent his turning and
lifting himſelf as in ſo narrow a Compaſs, he is
catch'd by thoſe who have laid the Trap.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>African Negroes</hi> eat his Fleſh, and I have
heard it affirm'd for Truth, that his Snout is very
delicious meat; but generally they are kill'd for
their Teeth ſake, tho' they alſo ſometimes fall
out of themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The Hyde rightly dreſs'd, is of ſuch thickneſs,
that they are proof againſt a Musket-ball; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the young ones are brought up and Tamed,
and are generally catch'd as they run aſtray, after
they have loſt the old ones by one accident or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Notwithſtanding the prodigious Bulk of this
Animal, it Swims extreamly well, and goes a great
pace; beſides which, it is as Courageous as it is
Strong, and does great Service to the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings
in their Wars.</p>
                        <p>During my abode in the <hi>Indies,</hi> there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Governor, who being willing to give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
piece of diverſion to ſome perſons of
Quality, cauſed an Elephant and Tyger to be
brought into a kind of an Amphitheatre, erected
for that purpoſe, to try their Strength and Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
againſt one another; the Tyger is a very nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creature, but much inferiour in Bulk to the
Elephant; his chief Strength lies in his Claws and
Teeth, of which he gave a ſufficient proof to his
Enemy;<note place="margin">Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an Elephant and Tyger.</note> for ſometimes he was upon his Back,
ſometimes under his Belly, where he left very
Bloody marks of his furious Attempts; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
on the other hand, uſed his Snout with a
great deal of dexterity, toſſing the Tyger at a
great diſtance, and endeavouring to trample him
under his Feet, whilſt the other tore his Skin in
every part where he could lay hold with his Claws
or Teeth. Their fury did not end till with the loſs
of their Lives, they continuing the Combat till
the Elephant preſſing with utmoſt violence upon
the Tyger, and the other faſtning with his Claws
to his Belly, they diſputed the Victory, till both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
dead upon the Spot.</p>

                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57955:54"/>
Thoſe who manage the Elephant are by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labars</hi>
called <hi>Cornac;</hi> they ſit upon the neck of the
Beaſt, where they hold themſelves without the help
of a Bridle; they have always two ſticks with Iron
Hooks at the end, one bigger than the other; the
ſmall one they uſe inſtead of a Spur, wherewith
they ſtrike the Elephant over the Head, to make
him go as they pleaſe; ſo that you ſeldom ſee any
of theſe Beaſts without a Wound on their Heads.
The other they make uſe of to keep the Elephant
back, and to make him ſtop when he is furious, and
when the little one is inſufficient.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen ſome Elephants belonging to ſome of
the <hi>Malabar</hi> Princes get looſe, who deſtroy every
thing they meet in their way, tear up Trees, and
pull down the Peaſants Cottages (which indeed
in thoſe parts, muſt not be imagined to be ſo well
built as ours) forcing the inhabitants to leave their
dwelling places, and to ſeek for ſhelter in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Towns; thus have I ſeveral times ſeen a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number of Country People come to our
Habitations, who dreading the fury of theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
had been forced to abandon their Houſes.</p>
                        <p>The Kings of the <hi>Malabars</hi> frequently employ
their Elephants to chaſtiſe their rebellious Subjects,
by letting them looſe into their Grounds, where
they deſtroy not only all the Fruits of the Earth,
but alſo the biggeſt Trees, there being not wanting
inſtances, that a large Elephant has torn up a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe-tree.</p>
                        <p>The Merchants in the <hi>Indies</hi> hire Elephants to

are three ſorts, diſtinguiſhed only by their different
ſizes.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is not much bigger than a large Cat; of
this kind I ſaw one, which was kept in the Houſe
of the <hi>French Eaſt-India</hi> Company, in the Kingdom
of <hi>Cananor,</hi> which was brought thither from <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcou,</hi>
and when he cry'd, made as much noiſe as
an Ox. They fed him commonly with Fleſh, and
if they threw him ſome Rice, he was ſo cunning as
to draw back as far as the Chain would give him
leave when he would watch his opportunity to
ſnatch up the Pullets and Ducks that came to feed
upon the Rice; at laſt our Tiger found means one
time to break his Chain, and to give us the Slip. I
was one of the foremoſt who purſued him, but got
nothing for my pains, but a Wound, which he
gave me with his Claws in the right hand, and ſo
he got into the open Fields, where we were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to overtake him.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond kind is as big as a good Mutton,<note place="margin">The ſecond kind.</note> or
a ſlender Calf; theſe as they are moſt common, ſo
they do the moſt miſchief among the Cattle, and
are therefore moſt cloſely purſued. The Princes in
thoſe parts to encourage their Subjects to deſtroy
theſe miſchievous Creatures, give always a
Bracelet of Gold to any Man that kills one of thoſe
Tigers, which preſent is look'd upon in the <hi>Indies</hi>
                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57955:55"/>
as a Badge of Honour, not unlike to our Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
no body being allowed to wear a Golden
Bracelet here, without being authorized to it by
the King of that Country, whoſe ſubject he is.</p>
                        <p>I was acquainted with an <hi>Indian,</hi> who alone kill'd
one of theſe Tigers, without receiving the leaſt
hurt, and had no other Arms but his Shield and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metar.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſiding at <hi>Batiepatan,</hi>

                           </note> had not the
ſame good fortune with a Tiger which uſed to
come now and then into their Grounds in the Night-time.
For having made great Havock all round
their Habitations for a conſiderable time, they took
a reſolution to watch his coming; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
having provided themſelves with Fire-arms,
they met and wounded him with a Ball out of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zee,
but the Wound not proving mortal, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
fell in among them with ſuch a Fury, that he
killed two or three of them, and got away.</p>
                        <p>I was once my ſelf in no ſmall danger of having
been ſurprized by this cruel Animal, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my arrival in <hi>Malabar.</hi> The exceſſive heat of
the Seaſon, made me very deſirous to lay abroad
very often, having three great Dogs near me for my
Guard. One Night I was all on a ſudden awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Cries, and ſeeing them fly away as
faſt as they could from a certain Animal, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
them with great Eagerneſs; I called for help,
and ſome of our Domeſticks being come with ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Torches to my aſſiſtance, we found two of the
Dogs, which were returned to the place where they
had left me, but the third was miſſing; we look'd
all about as far as we could, but in vain, not being
able to learn any tidings of our Dog till the next
day, when we found his Bones ſcattered at two
hundred paces from the Houſe. This adventure
ſerved me for a warning, not to expoſe my ſelf thus
for the future, by lying abroad all Night.</p>

Skins which were big enough to cover a Bed of ſix

living at <hi>Daman:</hi> He had a Country Houſe near
the ſaid City, whither two Friends of his being come
to give him a Viſit, he would needs divert them
with Hunting the wild Boar; going out early in the
Morning, in a Calaſh, each with a Fuzee, they
met with one of theſe <hi>Royal Tigers,</hi> and ſeeing him
at ſome diſtance, they agreed it would be beſt to
let fly at him, which <hi>John de Liquiera</hi> did with ſo much
dexterity,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> that he dropt down immediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

conceived that they were extreamly rejoyced at
their Victory, which they had gained at ſo cheap
a rate, and being in a ſolitary place, not far from
<hi>Liquiera</hi>'s Country Houſe, they reſolved to leave
their Prey, (which is eſteemed a great rarity by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Beauty of the Skin) till they had broke
their Faſt. But afterwards returning to the place,
they were not a little ſurprized when they found
neither the Tiger nor any tract of Blood; ſo that
<hi>John de Liquiera</hi> againſt the advice of his Friends,
getting out of the Calaſh into the adjacent Buſhes,
found the Tiger there wallowing in his own Blood;
but the enraged Animal, as if it had been ſenſible
of the approach of him who had given him his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Wound,<note place="margin">A <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> in danger of being torn in pieces by a Tiger.</note> flew upon him with ſo much fury,
that he threw him immediately upon the Ground,
and fell a tearing his Fleſh, where ever he fixed his
Claws. His other two Friends, who had follow'd
him at ſome diſtance, were at the greateſt incerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
what to do in this extremity, they wanting
Arms to come to a cloſe Engagement with the Tiger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to reſcue their Friend, and they durſt not make uſe of
their Fire-arms for fear of killing him inſtead of the
cruel Beaſt; their only hopes was, that the Tiger
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57955:56"/>
would be ſoon diſabled by the loſs of Blood, which
flowed like a ſtream out of his Wound; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his fierceneſs rather increaſe than abate, they
reſolved to venture all, and advancing as near as
they thought convenient, one of them ſhot the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with his Fuzee, ſo as that he drop'd down
dead upon the ſpot. They ran immediately to the
aſſiſtance of their Friend, whom they found with
his Face downwards, and his back and ſides torn in
ſo miſerable a manner, that it was the moſt tragical
Spectacle that ever was ſeen; they made a ſhift to
carry him to his own Houſe, where having laid him
upon a Bed, they found his Wounds in ſo deſperate
a condition, that they expected every moment,
when he would breath his laſt.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt they were in this confuſion, no body
knowing what to reſolve on, one of the <hi>Pagan</hi>
Slaves belonging to this Gentleman, having been
informed of his Maſter's misfortune, came into the
Room, and told them, That if they would leave
him to his care, he would certainly ſave him. There
was ſcarce any body who made any great reflections
upon what the Slave had aſſured them; but looking
upon their Friends caſe as deſperate, they accepted
his offer: And the Slave went immediately to apply
his remedy, which was made of the juice of certain
Herbs mix'd with Milk,<note place="margin">Marvellous cure.</note> by the help of which he
in time reſtored his Maſter to perfect Health, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him all the while, nothing elſe for his Dyet,
but Bread and Milk; a cure ſo miraculous, as ſcarce
will find credit in theſe parts.</p>

to this day the Skin of this Tiger, which being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

                        <p>To avoid the Tigers in the Night-time, nothing

a middle ſiezed Dog, reſembling a Fox to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

they are ſometimes tamed and entertained at home
among other Domeſtick Animals. When they are
Wild, they hide themſelves under Ground in the
Day-time, and never come abroad but in the Night,
when they look out for Pray. They commonly
appear in Troops, fall upon Children to devour
them, and ſometimes frighten Travellers that are
unprovided with Arms; they howl in a moſt dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner, not unlike the cries of a great many
Children of different Ages mix'd together. They
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57955:57"/>
are at perpetual War with the Dogs, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at their heels, if they appear near their dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Tigers, who never devour them, but make uſe
of them as their Setting Dogs, to draw the Houſe
Dogs into the Snare; wherefore the <hi>Indian</hi> Peaſants,
who are not ignorant of the cunning of the Tiger,
when they hear the <hi>Adive</hi> cry, take care to keep
their Dogs cloſe at home, for fear of the Tiger. It

                        <p>The <hi>Buffler</hi> is larger than an ordinary Ox,<note place="margin">The Buffler.</note> but

White, much larger; his Horns, alſo flat and
ſometimes ten foot long; his Legs very ſhort and
thick. It is an ugly Creature to look on, having
ſcarce any Hair. He goes very ſlow, but will carry
a great Burthen. You may ſee them feed in herds
like the Cows, and they give good ſtore of Milk,
whereof they make Butter and Cheeſe. Their fleſh

in the Woods they are not ſo much to be dreaded as

thoſe who are ſurprized by them, time to eſcape the

appear in the Fields in great Companies, where
they will watch their opportunity to ſet upon the

There are very few places in the World but
where Adders are to be met with, but thoſe of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and eſpecially of the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi>
having ſomething extraordinary beyond the reſt,
deſerve particularly to be taken notice of here.
I had heard ſo many ſurpriſing things of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came into this Country, that I look'd upon
them for the moſt part as Fables, contrived on
purpoſe by Travellers, to deceive the credulous
people; but I have ſince been convinced by my
own Experience; nothing being more certain than
what I am going to relate concerning the Adders on
the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of them are not above an Inch thick, but
5 or 6 Feet long, and of a Greeniſh Colour, ſo
that they are not eaſily to be diſcerned in the Graſs
and Buſhes,<note place="margin">Adders in <hi>Malabar.</hi>
                           </note> where they lie lurking to ſeize upon
ſuch as paſs by, and commonly endeavour to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
either on their Eyes, Noſes, or Ears. They
don't Communicate their Poyſon by making an
impreſſion with their Teeth, but they have a little
Bladder full of a very ſubtil Poyſon under their Necks,
from whence iſſues that venomous ſubſtance, which
in ſpite of all the beſt Antidotes, always proves
Mortal, and that in leſs than an Hours time. Theſe
Adders being ſo very frequent and difficult to be
diſcovered in theſe parts, all perſons of any Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when they Travel, cauſe their Servants to go
before them at a certain diſtance, who with little
rods beat the Buſhes, the better to diſcover thoſe
dangerous Inſects.</p>
                        <p>I knew an <hi>Indian</hi> who being a Chriſtian, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
with a <hi>Pagan Indian</hi> from <hi>Baſarto Batiepatan,</hi>
to viſit one of their <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples; but whilſt
they were upon the Road, one of theſe Green Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all upon a ſudden faſtned upon the <hi>Pagan In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>'s
Noſe, and creeping into his right Noſtril,
got out through the left, where ſhe remain'd till
the poor Fellow fell down Dead upon the Spot.</p>
                        <p>There is another kind of Adders in <hi>Malabar,</hi>
called by the <hi>Indians Nalle bambou,</hi> that is to ſay,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57955:59"/>
the good Adder; and by the <hi>Portugueſes Cobra capel,</hi>
becauſe it has a Skin of the breadth of a Hand
hanging over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its Head of divers Colours, as if it
were enamell'd, as all the reſt of the Body is of a
very lively and agreeable Colour. The bite of
this Adder is not accounted ſo dangerous as the
former, for tho' it often proves Mortal, yet its
fatal conſequences are ſometimes prevented by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Antidotes.</p>
                        <p>One cannot but be ſurprized at the moſt ſtupid
ignorance and blindneſs of thoſe <hi>Pagans,</hi> who pay
a moſt profound reverence to all ſorts of Reptils,
but eſpecially to the Adders; their Statues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up the chief Ornaments of their Temples.
They are blinded to ſuch a degree of ſuperſtition in
regard of theſe Creatures, that it is impoſſible to
undeceive them, and to make them open their
Eyes.<note place="margin">Superſtition of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Adders.</note> For if an Adder appear in a Houſe, they

don't prevail, they endeavour to draw her away

to diſlodge her by any violent means,
that they daily apply their Rhetorick and Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to her, no otherwiſe than if ſhe were a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creature.</p>
                        <p>A Secretary belonging to a certain Prince in thoſe
parts, was at the time whilſt I was in the Country,
wounded by one of theſe Adders; She was 8 Foot
long, and of the thickneſs of a Man's Arm; this
accident happening in the Country, the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
Servant took the Adder, which they encloſed
in an Earthen Veſſel, and brought her up to Court;
a Convocation of the <hi>Bramans</hi> being held, they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly
addreſſed their Prayers to the Adder,
intreating her in the moſt reſpectful manner that
could be, to ſpare the Life of the wounded Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
as being a perſon of great Ability in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and conſequently very uſeful to his Prince,
who threatned to burn the Adder, if She did not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57955:59"/>
take care to keep his Secretary alive; but this
Adder being very ſtubborn as it ſeems, their Prayers
and threats proved equally ineffectual; for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
being deſtitute in the Country of proper
Antidotes, died in a few days, to the no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
of his Prince; notwithſtanding which, being
perſwaded by the <hi>Bramans,</hi> that his Favourite muſt
needs have committed ſome ſecret and erroneous
Crime againſt their God, who had thought fit to
puniſh him thus. In expiation of his Crimes, he
ordered the Adder to be carried out of his Palace,
where ſhe was put in the Graſs, with a great deal
of Ceremony, the Prince and all his Courtiers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
paid her a great deal of reſpect, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their formal leave of this Deity.</p>
                        <p>There are a great many among the <hi>Indians</hi> ſo
over ſuperſtitious in their Zeal as to carry every

they miſemployed that talent, wherewith they
were intruſted by God; in thus groſly impoſing
upon the credulity of an ignorant people by their
fabulous inventions, barely in hopes of gaining
ſome reputation, and a ſlender ſhare of worldly

with what I alledged to him, that on the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57955:60"/>
contrary he perſiſted in juſtifying their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and had folly enough to endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me of the verity of their Doctrine by the
following Hiſtory. One of the Principal <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
belonging to one of the moſt famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> being very ſolicitous to
exhort his Auditors to Devotion, propoſed to them
the erecting a Statue of Gold of an Adder, with
12 Eggs of the ſame ſubſtance, which being to be
effected by a voluntary Contribution, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to be placed in a certain place within the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where it was to be Adored, he told them
that the ſame Statue in 6 Weeks time would not
only be turn'd into a live Adder of the ſame
bigneſs, but alſo hatch out of the 12 Eggs, ſo
many young ones, that would in time all become
Protectors of the ſaid Temple. His propoſition
being received with a general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſent, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
towards the erecting of the ſaid Statue
with ſuch a chearfulneſs, that it was ſoon brought
to perfection, and carried in great State by the
<hi>Bramans,</hi> followed by the joyful Acclamations of
a vaſt number of people to the Temple, where
it was ſet up in a place aſſigned for that purpoſe,
which was ſhut up cloſe by the principal <hi>Braman,</hi>
till the 6 Weeks were expired; when having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
aſſembled the people, he went at the Head
of them to the ſame place where they had left the
Statue lock'd up before; and not finding the leaſt
Remnants either of the Golden Adder, or the 12
Eggs, they unanimouſly concluded that they were
all turn'd into Living Adders. The Miracle was
followed by an univerſal Acclamation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
each of them ſtriving to out-do the other, in
giving the moſt evident Demonſtrations of Joy
for having been the happy Inſtruments of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of thoſe new Deities.</p>
                        <p>Tho' I could ſcarce forbear Laughing at the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs
of this contrivance, yet the impudence
wherewith it was related by the <hi>Braman</hi> put me
into ſuch a Paſſion, that I gave him ſufficiently to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57955:60"/>
underſtand that I was not to be impoſed upon by
ſuch Tricks; but he was ſo brazen faced as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in his former aſſurance, ſo that I was forced to
leave him to his own obſtinacy.</p>
                        <p>But tho' the <hi>Pagans</hi> have impoſed upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
this as an unalterable Law, not to kill an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not obliged
to the ſame rule in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where you often
meet with them in your Dwelling Houſes; nay,
I have ſeveral times found them lurking under the
Beds. What Antidote is moſt effectual to be made
uſe of againſt the Poyſon of this Creature, I ſhall
have occaſion to ſpeak more at large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The Adders of the largeſt ſize, are near 20 Foot
long, and of ſo vaſt a thickneſs, that they are able
to ſwallow a Man; but they are leſs dangerous
than the reſt, becauſe they are ſooner diſcovered,
and conſequently eaſier to be avoided. Beſides,
that they are ſcarce ever to be met with, unleſs it
be in deſarts; and, if they are ſometimes ſeen near
great Towns or on the Banks or Shoar of the Sea
or Rivers, it is commonly after ſome great inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the latter, whereby they are ſometimes
carried near to the abovementioned places; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw any of them but what were Dead, which
appear'd no otherwiſe than a Trunk of a large Tree
lying upon the Ground.</p>
                        <p>I heard once a Chriſtian who had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Pagan,</hi> relate a very remarkable Hiſtory of
one of theſe Adders:<note place="margin">A Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of an Adder.</note> It ſeems it was in Harveſt-time,
and certain Country people being gone into
the Field to reap Rice, had left no body at home
but a Sick Child; which being got without doors,
had laid it ſelf aſleep, near the Houſe, upon ſome
Leaves, where it thus continu'd till Night; all the
Domeſticks being then returned from reaping, heard
ſome out-cries of the Child, which, being weary
of the fatigues they had undergone in the Field,
they did not much regard, as believing them to
proceed from the illneſs of the Child; but whilſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57955:61"/>
Supper was getting ready, ſome of them having in
the mean while obſerving the Child to continue
its Cries, in a moſt lamentable manner, ran out
towards the place, where they found it almoſt
ſwallowed up by one of thoſe Adders; one half of
the Child being within the Body of this venomous
Creature: It is eaſie to be imagined in what a
Conſternation ſo unfortunate an accident put the
whole Family, but eſpecially the Parents, who
did not know by what means to preſerve the Child
from preſent Death; being afraid that if they
ſhou'd do any thing to exaſperate this Creature,
it would at once devour the Child; after ſeveral
propoſitions made by the beholders of ſo Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
a Spectacle equally dangerous in the execution
of it, they reſolved to try whether they could with
a good Cimetar cut the Adder aſunder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
which was executed accordingly, with a great
deal of dexterity. But this venomous Creature
was ſo ſtrong lived, as not to die immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was cut in pieces, ſo that it cloſed up the
unfortunate Child within the one half of his Body,
where it was ſoon venom'd ſo as that it dy'd in a
few Minutes after the Serpent.</p>
                        <p>One Evening we heard a Jaccal or Adive, cry
near our Habitation, which notwithſtanding the
Barking of all the Dogs round about us, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to approach nearer and nearer; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Servants being got abroad with lighted
Torches, made up towards the place, where they
heard the Jaccal cry, whom they found very near
devoured, by one of theſe Adders, who had que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs
ſurprized him aſleep; our Servants kill'd
both of them, and the Adder tho' not above 10
Foot long, yet was of ſuch a thickneſs as to be
able to ſwallow ſo large a Creature as the Jaccal.</p>

                        <p>THE Inhabitants of <hi>Malabar</hi> are generally well
ſhaped, all of them Black, or at leaſt very
Brown, but are not near ſo ugly as the <hi>Africans.</hi>
They let their Hair grow to a great length; they
don't want natural Ingenuity, but very rarely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it by any uſeful Arts or Sciences. They
are very Treacherous, breach of Faith being their
daily practice. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> are accounted
the moſt perfidious, but the <hi>Pagans</hi> ſo cloſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their foot-ſteps in this point, that they almoſt
out-do their Maſters.</p>
                        <p>The laſt of theſe two are the off-ſpring of the
Ancient Natives of the Country, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceed the others in number. They are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
into ſeveral Degrees, or Tribes. The firſt
is that of the Princes;<note place="margin">Several Tribes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Malabars.</hi>
                           </note> the ſecond of the <hi>Nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouris,</hi>
or their chief Prieſts; the <hi>Bramans</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prieſts are of the third, and the <hi>Nahers,</hi> or
the Gentlemen of the fourth Rank. Theſe as they
are by their Birth-right intitled to the prerogative
of bearing Arms, ſo they are not allowed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with Traffick, which if they do, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their Gentility, as they do likewiſe if they change
their Religion.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe whom they call <hi>Tives,</hi> apply themſelves
to Husbandry and gathering the <hi>Tary,</hi> or Palm-Tree-Wine,
theſe are alſo ſuffered to bear Arms, but
this is only by permiſſion. The <hi>Moconas</hi> or Fiſher-Men
are all obliged to live near the Sea-Shoar,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57955:62"/>
and not permitted to follow any other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are not ſuffered to bear Arms, even not
in caſe of the greateſt extremity. The <hi>Mainats</hi> or
whiteners of Linen, the Weavers, and thoſe that
make it their Employment to draw it, are divided
into ſo many different Degrees or Tribes.</p>
                        <p>The vileſt and moſt contemptible of all are the
<hi>Pouliats,</hi> being deſpiſed by the reſt, and living in
a manner like vagabonds in moſt wretched Huts,
made of the Leaves of the Palm-Tree; their whole
Employment is to watch in the Fields, where the
Rice grows. It is look'd upon as ſcandalous to
have any Converſation with them, nay, even to
approach them, and if any of the other Tribes
happen to ſpeak to them unleſs it be at 10 or 12
Yards diſtance, they are obliged to purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before they come into any other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                        <p>If a <hi>Nambouri, Braman,</hi> or a <hi>Naher</hi> meets with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe <hi>Pouliats</hi> upon the Road, they command
them at firſt ſight, to get out of the way, which
if they do not obey in an inſtant, they let fly at them
with their Muskets or Arrows, and kill them at
pleaſure, provided it be not in ſome Sanctified
or Privileged place. If a <hi>Naher</hi> or Gentleman has
a mind to make trial of his Arms, he may ſhew
his dexterity upon one of thoſe unfortunate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
without any regard to Age or Sex, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be called to an account for it. This vile
Generation being ſubject to ſo many diſaſters, it is
no wonder if they don't propagate ſo faſt as the
reſt of the <hi>Indians;</hi> their condition being look'd
upon ſo mean as not to be permitted to wear any
kind of Stuffs or Linen, but only to cover ſome
part of their Bodies with Leaves. They eat fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Carrion, nay, even Inſects, and what makes
them above all others abominable to the <hi>Pagan In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
is, that they eat Beef, which died a natural
Death. They are ſo deſpiſable as that no Preſents,
neither for their Gods, or their Princes, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of from them, unleſs it be Gold or Silver;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57955:62"/>
but they are obliged to lay it down at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and retire immediately from the place, when
the <hi>Nahers,</hi> who are the Guards of the Prince's
Perſon, come and take it up, talking to them at a
diſtance, and giving them what anſwer is to be
made, without allowing them to approach within
20 Paces near to them. They are often fined in
very great Sums; and becauſe it may ſeem ſtrange
how they that are baniſh'd from all civil Society,
and have no way to improve themſelves, ſhould
be in a capacity to pay them; it is to be obſerved,
that the <hi>Malabars</hi> are ſo fooliſhly Superſtitious, as
to Bury moſt of their Gold and Silver with them
after their Death, and it is look'd upon as a Crime
to Rob the Dead. But the <hi>Pouliats</hi> frequently
watch their opportunity to find out theſe hidden
Treaſures, and to convert them to their own uſe;
which makes them to be conſidered among the
<hi>Malabars,</hi> as Sorcerers, and an infamous Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
guilty of the moſt inormous Crimes; for which
reaſon it is, that upon the leaſt ſuſpicion they are
accuſed and condemned to Death. But the other
Tribes are not uſed with ſo much rigour, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to be Convicted even in evil caſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
very ſubſtantial Evidence.</p>
                        <p>It is a fundamental Law among the <hi>Malabars,</hi>
as well as moſt other Nations of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which
they look upon as unalterable and never to be
neglected, to wit, That no body can riſe beyond
the degree of his Tribe, wherein he is Born, and
let his Riches be never ſo great, neither he nor his
Poſterity can exclude themſelves from that Tribe,
or change their Condition.</p>

and may eaſily be diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt
by their civil Demeanour and Converſation, as
well as by their Birth. There is a moſt ancient
Cuſtom, which time has eſtabliſh'd for a Law in
all the Kingdoms on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar;</hi> that
all Strangers or others, who are not <hi>Pagans,</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
never to Travel without a Guard of one or
more of theſe <hi>Nahers;</hi> this being an indiſpenſible
neceſſity laid upon Travellers; becauſe theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
never take cogniſance of any violences offered
them, if they Travel without theſe Guards. If
they are to Travel from one Kingdom to another,
the <hi>Nahers</hi> of the place where they are, take care
to procure them out of the other Kingdoms, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they intend to go, ſome who are to conduct
them. To every one of theſe <hi>Nahers</hi> you pay eight
<hi>Tares per diem,</hi> which amounts to half a <hi>Fanon.</hi>
The <hi>Fanon</hi> is a ſmall piece of Gold worth 16 <hi>Tares;</hi>
and the <hi>Tare</hi> is a ſmall Silver Coin worth about a
half-penny. Each <hi>Naher</hi> has not above 4 <hi>Tares</hi> a
day, when he keeps Guard in a Houſe, but when
he Travels he has double pay.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Nahers</hi> have this moſt excellent quality,
that they never betray or abandon ſuch Travellers
as they Guard upon the Road. If a Man happen
to loſe his Life, whilſt he is under their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will not ſurvive him, but undergo the
ſame fate; if they ſhould do otherwiſe, they would
be look'd upon as Cowards.</p>

                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57955:63"/>
I have received a relation from very good Hands,
which well deſerves to be inſerted here: Two
Rich <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchants Travelling along the
<hi>Malabar</hi> Coaſt, from the Northern to the Southern
parts, were purſuant to the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Conducted by ſeveral <hi>Nahers,</hi> through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Cananor;</hi> but coming to the Borders of
the Kingdom of <hi>Samorin,</hi> were provided with new
Guards, to protect them in their Journey through
that Kingdom. But theſe perfidious wretches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inticed by the great quantity of Gold and
Jewels theſe Merchants carried with them, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred
them, and having robbed them of all their
Precious Moveables, retired to another Kingdom,
in hopes to find ſhelter there againſt the ſeverity
of the Law. After the firſt, to whoſe care they
were committed, were returned to their homes,
the News of the Murther ſoon ſpread over the
Country, their Dead Carcaſſes having ſoon after
the Fact was commited, been diſcovered by ſome
others Travelling on the ſame Road; they were
examined concerning their Conduct, and having
given an exact Account, to whoſe care they had
left theſe Merchants, theſe Ruffians Names were
ſoon known, and conſequently they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and ſent to their Native Country, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
condign Puniſhment. Some part of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
which they had taken from the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Merchants being found upon them, when they
were ſeized, was a convincing proof of their Guilt,
wherefore being Condemned to Death, their Wives
and neareſt Kindred appear'd at the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
telling them, <hi>That ſince they had Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Fact tending ſo much to the Diſhonour of their
Family, they ought to be the Executioners, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
them out of the way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another thing worth obſerving of theſe
<hi>Nahers;</hi> That Travellers who are Conducted by
a good number of theſe Guards, are often expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to more danger, than if they were guided by
one of their Children; it being the cuſtom of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57955:64"/>
                           <hi>Indian</hi> Robbers, never to hurt any Children or
ſuch as are not able to defend themſelves; but
never to ſpare any that are provided with Arms for
their Defence.</p>
                        <p>When theſe Children of the <hi>Nahers</hi> Travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Country, they are only provided with a
twiſted Stick of a Foot and a half long, with a
handle a-top moſt like our Daggers or Bagonets;
but in lieu of being ſharp at the end, it is as thick
at the bottom as a Fiſt; and this kind of Stick
they make uſe of till they come to the Age ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their bearing of Arms. No body but
the Sons of the <hi>Nahers</hi> are permitted to wear ſuch
a Stick, by which they are diſtinguiſh'd from the
reſt, and when they thus Travel, they are not
allowed above three half-pence a day apiece.
But though this be the ſecureſt way of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
none but the Poorer ſort make uſe of them,
becauſe that Travellers are commonly reſpected
in this Country according to the number of Guards,
which attend them from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

He happening to paſs by our Habitation

to ſend her frequently with ſome other young Maids
of the ſame Quality into the Field to look after his
Grounds; where having ſeen this young <hi>Tive,</hi> ſhe
began to feel at firſt ſome tender ſentiments for
his Perſon, but conſidering the inequality of their
Extraction, check'd her inclinations for ſome time,
till the young Countryman being become ſenſible of
her Paſſion, did by degrees ſo ſtrongly inſinuate
himſelf into her Affection, that in ſpite of all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour

Heart, ſo that ſhe reſolved to admit him privately
into her Uncle's Houſe, which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

his life.</p>
                        <p>They have no cloſe or barricado'd Priſons in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi>

                        <p>All cauſes both Civil and Criminal are pleaded

his Hand a leaf of the Bananas Tree, and a top
of that the hot Iron, which he is not to throw upon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57955:66"/>
the Ground, till after the redneſs be gone; after
which, one who has the overſight over the Prince's
Laundry, ſtanding by with a Napkin dipp'd in
water made of Rice, wraps it about his Hand,
and after having tied round about it a certain
Cord or Ribband, the Prince Seals it up with his
Signet: Three days after the Hand is opened,
and if there be no marks of any hurt done by the
Hot Iron, he is declared innocent; but if there
appear any impreſſion made by the heat of the
Iron, he is look'd upon as a Perjur'd Perſon, and
Puniſh'd accordingly.</p>
                        <p>It is the Prince in Perſon, who is always to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Sentence, from whence there lies no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
and if the Criminal be Condemn'd to Death,
it is Executed immediately upon the Spot, only
leading him without the Precinct of the Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe parts look upon it as the
moſt glorious Action they can do, to Obey their Prince
without reſerve, they have no occaſion to employ
common Executioners upon ſuch like occaſions,
but the <hi>Nahers</hi> belonging to the Prince's Guards
are the moſt forward to execute his Orders againſt
theſe miſerable Wretches; nay, nothing is more
common, than if the Crime be very heinous, for
the next Kindred of the Criminal, to ſtrive who
ſhall be the firſt that ſhall give the fatal blow to his
Kinſman, to expiate as they ſay, the indignity he
has put upon the Family.</p>
                        <p>Their common way of putting Criminals to
Death, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by running a Lance quite through their
Bodies, after which, they cut them into Quarters,
which are hang'd upon Trees.</p>
                        <p>In each Kingdom among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> there are
ſeveral Princely Families, which are altogether
deſcended and make up one Royal Line, ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in Rank to all the reſt. It is a general Cuſtom
in all the States of the <hi>Malabars,</hi> that after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
of the King, the moſt Ancient of all the
Princes ſucceeds without the leaſt oppoſition from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57955:67"/>
the reſt, ſo that a young Sovereign is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt thing the New King does after his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the Throne,<note place="margin">Their right of Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is, to chuſe one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his own Subjects, whom he believes to be
moſt underſtanding and fitteſt for ſo high a Truſt,
for his Lieutenant-General, who's Buſineſs is to
take upon him, the chief management of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Moment. This is the higheſt dignity in
the State, and though it be always expoſed to
Sail, yet does the King reſerve to himſelf the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of chooſing out of the Pretenders, ſuch a
one as he likes beſt, and whom he thinks moſt
deſerving, without any regard to his Birth or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
ſo that a <hi>Naher</hi> or <hi>Chati,</hi> being inveſted with
this Dignity, will make himſelf to be obeyed by
the Princes themſelves; tho' it happens alſo very
often that this Office is conferred upon Perſons of
Eminent Quality. All their Acts and Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
are written with a kind of an Iron Pen, upon
the Leaves of the Wild Palm-Tree.</p>
                        <p>The King being fully ſatisfied in the Zeal and
Prudence of his Chief Miniſter of State, leaves
the whole management of Affairs to his Conduct,
and for the moſt part Lives in a retired place, but
with a great deal of Magnificence. This Governor
General manages altogether the whole Treaſury;
it is he that makes Peace and War, without being
obliged to Communicate with any Body, unleſs it
be with the King himſelf, if, by reaſon of his great
Age, he be not incapable of taking cogniſance of
publick Affairs; He remains always ſtanding in
the King's Preſence, permits not any of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
or Guards to enter his Bed-Chamber, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeaks to him, without laying his Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Mouth. He muſt be very careful in not
neglecting the leaſt punctilio of theſe Ceremonies,
a fault of this nature not being to be repaired, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
with the loſs of his Office, the King always
reſerving to himſelf the liberty of diſcharging his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57955:67"/>
primier Miniſter from his place, when he pleaſes,
which however is very rarely ſeen in thoſe parts,
where they act with a great deal of circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in a matter of ſo great conſequence.</p>
                        <p>When the King of <hi>Cananor</hi> goes abroad, he is
either carried upon the Back of an Elephant,<note place="margin">How their Kings and Princes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick.</note> or
elſe in a Palanquin, being Adorned with a Crown
of Maſſive Gold upon his Head, made not unlike
a Ducal Bonnet. This Crown weighs ſomething
above 200 Guineas in Gold, and is always given
by the New Governor-General, immediately after
his Elevation to that Dignity, the Crown of the
laſt Deceaſed King being to be repoſited in the
Treaſury of the chief <hi>Pagod</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Temple.
The King is ſurrounded by his Guards compoſed
out of the <hi>Nahers,</hi> under the ſound of Drums and
Trumpets, and other Warlike Inſtruments. Some
Officers of his Court march at ſome diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Guards, whoſe Buſineſs is to make way,
and to cry the King is coming. All the Princes
if they go abroad by themſelves, as alſo the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
are ſerved with the ſame Magnificence; If
the Governour or Chief Miniſter of State be a
Prince, he goes abroad in the ſame Pomp, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his high extraction, not of the dignity of
his Office. But if he be not of the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he is only attended by his Guards, without the
ſounding of any Inſtruments of War, neither is he
preceeded by any Officers who clear the way before
him.</p>

they are counted to be of the ſame Race,
not of that of their Father's, the reaſon of which,
we ſhall have occaſion to mention anon.</p>
                        <p>Princeſſes are Married here to the <hi>Nambouri's,</hi> or
<hi>Bramans,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">What Rules they obſerve in their Marriages.</note> and the Children begotten betwixt them
are Princes, and lawful Succeſſors of the Crown,
each in their Rank. But, as there is not a ſufficient
number of Princeſſes to furniſh all the <hi>Nambouri's,</hi>
and <hi>Bramans</hi> with Wives, ſo they are allowed to
Marry Women of the ſame Rank with themſelves,
and the Children begotten betwixt them are either
<hi>Nambouri's</hi> or <hi>Bramans,</hi> according to the Quality of

                        <p>The Princes Marry the Daughters of the <hi>Nahers,</hi>
but never any Princeſſes, and the Children begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                        <p>The <hi>Nahers</hi> are obliged to Marry one of the

themſelves, to wit, of the <hi>Minats</hi> or <hi>Cheti.</hi> The

themſelves, but, as we ſaid before, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
muſt not debaſe themſelves in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

                        <p>The <hi>Malabar</hi> Princes, the <hi>Nambouri's</hi> and <hi>Bramans,</hi>
as alſo the chiefeſt among the <hi>Nahers,</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
but one Wife, and they endeavour by all
obliging means in the World to engage them to
be faithful to them, and not to look out for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband, which is not in their power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
by any other than gentle means, this liberty
being allowed to the <hi>Malabar</hi> Women, provided
they don't Marry below themſelves. For the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
Women in theſe parts (contrary to what is
practiſed among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi>) enjoy according
to the Cuſtom of their Country this Prerogative,
to Marry as many Husbands as they pleaſe; and
what is the moſt ſurprizing, is, that all this is
done without the leaſt diſorder or Jealouſie; for,
the Man when he comes to pay his Duty to his
Lady leaves his Arms at the Chamber-door, as a
ſure ſign to the reſt, that the place is taken up, and
that they muſt ſtay his leiſure before they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>Their Marriage-engagements are only during
pleaſure, and when they are ſatisfied with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
they part as freely as they met. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
preſent which the New Married Men make
to their Wives, is, a piece of Linen Cloth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to cover themſelves.</p>
                        <p>It is from this Cuſtom of Marrying ſo many
Husbands, and to abandon them at pleaſure, that
their Children owe their Pedigree to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it being impoſſible to know their true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
neither are the Sons here conſidered as the
next Heirs, but the Nephews, but they muſt be
the Siſter's Sons.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> tho' they keep a moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eye over their Wives, nevertheless do they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this Cuſtom, in reſpect of Succeſſion or Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,

                        </p>

                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57955:69"/>
They Marry their Daughters for the moſt part
at 12 Years of Age, and there are abundance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them who bear Children before that Age,
tho' they are generally but very ſmall, which may
perhaps be Attributed to their being Married at ſo
tender an Age.</p>
                        <p>Widwives are unknown in theſe parts, thoſe of
a more advanced Age ſupply this defect in a
Country where they are Delivered with much
eaſe, in Compariſon to what is done in <hi>Europe.</hi>
For the <hi>Malabar</hi> as well as the <hi>African</hi> Women,
are no ſooner Deliver'd, but they waſh themſelves,
and take no further care of their Babes, than to
give them Suck.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Malabar</hi> Women are for the generality well
ſhap'd, and not ill Featured, but the little ones are
in greater eſteem than the tall ones; the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Marrying ſo many Husbands as they pleaſe,
exempts them from that moſt cruel Cuſtom of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>AS to their Habits, there is ſcarce any difference
betwixt the Men and the Women in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar;</hi>
they wear their Hair, which is Black, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long, and go Naked as far as the middle; even
the Princes themſelves, who, if they ſometimes
make uſe of a ſmall Veſt, always leave it open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
They wear about their Middle a piece of
Cloth, which comes down as low as their Knees,
and never make uſe of Shooes or Stockings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57955:69"/>
In other Countries Ladies of Quality endeavour
to out-vie one another by their rich Gold and
Silver Stuffs; but the quite contrary is practiſed
among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> where theſe Stuffs are not
worn but by the meaner ſort, the Ladies of the
<hi>Nahers</hi> and all the reſt of a Superiour Rank wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but fine White Callico. The richer
ſort wear Girdles of Gold, and Bracelets of Silver
or Horn, in which, they take all moſt particular
Pride. The Women never adorn themſelves with any
Jewels, unleſs it be a Ring. Both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have holes in their Ears, which are ſo long,
that they hang down quite to their Shoulders;
becauſe they are ſo careful in continually enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holes, that you may thruſt a Fiſt into them,
which is occaſioned by the weight of the Pendants,
who ſometimes exceed two Ounces; ſome of
them wear Golden Chains, but theſe being the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
marks of the King's favour, are never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
but upon ſuch as have ſignalized themſelves
by ſome remarkable Action. All the <hi>Malabars</hi>
Shave their Beards cloſe, except ſome few, that
wear Muſtachio's.</p>
                        <p>Their Houſes are commonly made of Earth, and
inſtead of Tiles they cover them with the Leaves
of the <hi>Cocoe</hi>-Tree, it being a great rarity here to
ſee a Houſe of Stone or Brick. Their Furniture
conſiſts in ſome Baskets and a few Earthen Pots and
Diſhes; their Cups are of the ſame matter, and
their Kings themſelves make uſe of them as the
<hi>European</hi> Princes do of Gold and Silver Veſſels.
They have no other Light at Nights, but what
their Lamps furniſh them with, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
by the Oyl drawn from the Cocoes; when
they eat, they always turn their Back to the Light.
As they are never ſenſible of Cold here, ſo they
don't make uſe of Chimneys, but what Fire they
have occaſion for, to dreſs their Victuals, is made
without Doors. Wheat being a ſcarce Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> they make uſe only
of Rice inſtead of it. Their Diſhes are dreſſed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57955:70"/>
without Sauces, and conſequently very unſavory;
their Beds are nothing elſe but Deal Boards, which
the Richer ſort cover with Tapeſtry ſuitable to their
Quality, and the Poor only with Mats. There is
no Villages to be ſeen all over <hi>Malabar,</hi> every
one has his ſeparate Habitation, and incloſure in
the Country; and, it is impoſſible for all of them
to live near the River ſide, and that it is a conſtant
Cuſtom among them, not to make uſe of their
Neighbour's Water, there is no Houſe ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        <p>THEIR <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples are moſt Magnificent,
being generally covered with Copper, and
ſometimes with Silver. There is always a Baſin
near the Temple, proportionable in bigneſs to the
largeneſs of the Temple, where the <hi>Pagans</hi> purifie
themſelves before they approach their Idols. The
number of the <hi>Bramans</hi> is regulated according to
the Revenues belonging to the Temple. Every
day there is a certain quantity of Rice allotted for
the uſe of the Poor that live near it, as alſo for the
benefit of ſuch Strangers as paſs by that way, let
them be of what Religion they will; the <hi>Pagans</hi>
having only this Prerogative to enter within the
Temple, whereas, the others are obliged to remain
without Doors, under certain Barracks made for
that purpoſe, where they may Sleep, if Night
ſurprize them in their Journey.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the ordinary Revenue of theſe <hi>Pagan</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57955:70"/>
which are given to the <hi>Bramans,</hi> who are
to offer it to the Idols. And as theſe Offerings don't
conſiſt in any thing that has Life, ſo they are moſt
commonly Rice, Butter, Fruits, Preſerves, Gold,
or Silver; the two laſt are but rarely offered, and
the reſt ſerve the <hi>Bramans</hi> for the Maintenance of

to bring forth their empty Diſhes to theſe ignorant
people, who think it a Crime to believe otherwiſe,
than what they have offered to have been conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                        <p>Some of the richeſt Temples have large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories

and upon the moſt Innocent occaſion in the

leaſt reſpect to his Merits or Quality; nay, they
uſe ſo much Rigour in this point, that if any one
ſaves himſelf by flight, the next a-kin to him muſt
pay for it with his Life, to expiate, as they ſay, the

                        <p>Of this I ſaw an inſtance, during my ſtay in theſe

who was a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> receive a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Summ of Money in Ducats, took a reſolution
to lie in wait for him at a certain place, through
which he was to paſs, to kill him, and ſeize the
Money for their own uſe. Accordingly they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him at ſome diſtance, till they overtook him
at a certain place, which they believed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Precinct of the Territories belonging to
the Temple of <hi>Batiepatan,</hi> where they run him
through in ſeveral places, till they had killed him,
and ſo retired to <hi>Calicut,</hi> under the Juriſdiction of
the King of <hi>Samorin.</hi> The Dead Carcaſs of the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Merchant having been ſoon after found,
the <hi>Bramans</hi> were conſulted, and being come to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57955:71"/>
place, they declared that he that had committed
the Murther, had defiled the Holy Ground of their
Idol, the place being within the Territories (which
are of a very large extent,) belonging to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Complaints being made hereof to Prince <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitri,</hi>
he cauſed an exact enquiry to be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Malefactor's Names and place of Abode,
who being two Brothers, they were Summon'd to
make their Appearance before the Prince, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Flight of his Nephews; he anſwered, that he
was ignorant both of the cauſes and manner of the
Flight of his Nephews, but this availed but little;
for the Prince told him that he would give him
8 Days to find out his Nephews, and if in the mean
time he did not bring them forth, he ſhould be

                        <p>BEſides that theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> Worſhip many Idols,
which have no reſemblance to any thing in the
World; there are ſeveral kinds of living Creatures,
whom they adore, but the moſt profound reſpect
they pay to the Sun and Moon. As at the new
Moon, they make great rejoycings, ſo when ſhe
is Eclipſed, they appear abroad, making moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
out-cries, whereby, as they ſay, they frighten
away the Dragon, who then endeavours to devour
the Moon. They uſe the ſame Veneration to their
Kings, as they do to their Gods, and they Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
old Age to ſo high a Degree, that even the
moſt Potent and Richeſt of the <hi>Nahers,</hi> will not ſit
down before thoſe that are conſiderably older than
themſelves, though their Enemies.</p>
                        <p>They count their time by the Moon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, their Feſtivals are not fixed to
certain days, this depending meerly on the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
of the <hi>Bramans.</hi> Theſe Prieſts are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in their Faſts, and upon any Solemn Day, they
call together ſuch as live within a reaſonable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the <hi>Temple,</hi> from whence they bring forth
the Idol, and having placed it upon an Elephant
very righly Harnaſſed,<note place="margin">Their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.</note> they carry it about in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
at the ſight of which, the People to ſhew
their utmoſt Veneration, proſtrate themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground. The Elephant is ſurrounded by a
good number of the <hi>Nahers,</hi> who having each a
Fan tied to a long Cane in their hands, drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Flies; which, as the Bramans ſay, would
elſe be troubleſome to their Gods, but in effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57955:72"/>
they would not incommode themſelves. Whilſt
the People make a confuſed Noiſe with divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
and their joyful Acclamations, one of
the <hi>Bramans,</hi> with a two edged Cymetar in his
hand, having ſome ſmall Bells hanging at the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
runs round about the Elephant, and after a
thouſand ridiculous and extravagant Poſtures, which
are look'd upon by the People as Myſterious,
he wounds himſelf in the Head, offering his Blood
as a Sacrifice to the Idol, which is as little known
to him, as it is ſenſible of his extravagant impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.</p>
                        <p>Thus after having taken their Rounds through
ſuch places as were appointed for that days Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
they carry the Idol back to the Temple in
the ſame manner, as it was brought out before. They
have alſo ſeveral other Ceremonies, which being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
to relate, we will paſs by in ſilence.</p>
                        <p>They burn the dead Bodies of their Princes, of
the <hi>Nambouri's,</hi> the <hi>Bramans,</hi> and the <hi>Nahers,</hi> but all
the reſt of an inferiour Rank, are interred.</p>

                        <p>ALL the <hi>Malabars</hi> in general,<note place="margin">Are very dexterous at their Arms.</note> who are capable
of bearing Arms, uſe them with great Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
they take particular care to inſtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in thoſe Exerciſes, and ſcarce are they able to
walk upwright, but they are furniſhed with Bows
and Arrows, which they make uſe of to ſhoot at the
Birds. They are ſo very careful in this point, that
in each Kingdom there are maintained certain Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
at the King's Charge, where the young
People are trained up in their Exerciſe of Arms.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57955:72"/>
The <hi>Indians</hi> are furniſhed with the materials for
their Arms from abroad, but they make them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
themſelves for their own uſe.</p>
                        <p>Their Muſquets are very light, though they are
ſix foot long, and there is no <hi>Naher,</hi> but he always
carries a mould about him for his Ball. They don't
lay the But-end of their Muſquets to their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but on their Cheeks, when they are going to
give fire,<note place="margin">Their Arms.</note> and are moſt excellent Marks-men. They
make uſe alſo of a Lance, a Cymetar, and the Bow;
of the laſt of which they are maſters to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that I have ſeen them frequently ſhoot two
Arrows immediately one after another into the Air,
with ſo much Dexterity, that the ſecond hit the
firſt.</p>
                        <p>Their Bows are ſix foot long, their Arrows
three; the Iron at the point about three inches
broad, and eight long: They do not carry them
in a Quiver as they do at <hi>Suratte,</hi> where they are
not near ſo big, but they hold always ſeven or
eight of them ready in their hands. Beſides this,
they have faſtned to their ſides with an iron Hook a
ſort of a large Knife or Bagonet, of about half a foot
broad, and a foot and a half long; this they make
uſe of when they come to a cloſe Engagement.
Thoſe who wear Cymetars make uſe of Bucklers;
all of them wear their Arms without Scabbards or
any other Coverts, for which reaſon they are very
careful to keep them neat and bright.</p>
                        <p>The young People frequently perform their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of Arms in the preſence of the Prince, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome others of the moſt eminent rank in the

                        <p>Thoſe who have a more than ordinary eſteem of

of Quality at certain times appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to be judges of their Ability in the feats of
Arms, when the prize is given to ſuch as behave

in theſe Combats, with ſo much vigour, that it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57955:73"/>
moſt commonly coſts the lives of ſeveral young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                        <p>If their happen to be a Family quarrel betwixt the
<hi>Nahers,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Family quarrels how decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> they chooſe one or more of their vaſſels of
a mean condition on each ſide, who being well Fed
and Educated for that purpoſe, are appointed by
joint conſent to decide the Quarrel. Time and
place being agreed on by the parties concerned,
the Prince appears there with his whole Court, in
whoſe preſence theſe Gladiators being armed only
with certain Knives or Bagonets, invented and uſed
only for this purpoſe, fight naked till by the death
of one party or the other, the quarrel be decided in
favour of the Conqueror, who very often does not
long ſurvive the Victory.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Malabars</hi> are generally very patient, and
not eaſily put in a Paſſion; Beſides which it ought
to be mentioned to their Honour, that they never
revenge themſelves by any clandeſtine means, but
give themſelves due ſatisfaction by the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
ways that poſſibly can be, the uſe of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
being not ſo much as known among them.</p>
                        <p>When they go abroad into the Wars, they march
without obſerving the leaſt order, without making
any account of Rank or File. They fight barely
out of a point of Honour, or at the moſt for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Pillage, theſe Kings being moſt infected with
the Ambition of enlarging their Territories, it
brings a general received Cuſtom among the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>

                        <p>THE Mahometans in <hi>Malabar</hi> owe their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
to ſuch Foreigners of their Religion,
as formerly have ſettled themſelves in thoſe parts for
the conveniency of Commerce. For few of the
Pagans, but eſpecially the <hi>Nahers,</hi> never apply
themſelves to it, which is the reaſon, that moſt of
the Commodities imported, or exported, paſs thro'
the hands of Strangers. The Villages or places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by theſe Foreign Merchants, are called in
the <hi>Malabar</hi> Tongue, <hi>Baſars,</hi> which is as much as
to ſay, a Market-place. The moſt conſiderable of
theſe trading places are generally ſeated on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar,
or near the mouth of ſome River or another,
for the more conveniency of the Foreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who are for the moſt part <hi>Europeans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mahometans dwelling in thoſe parts are a vile
and treacherous ſort of People, abundance of them live
upon Piracy, and attack all Ships they meet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any difference,<note place="margin">Malabar Corſairs.</note> provided they think them not
able to reſiſt them; but what makes them moſt
dreaded, is, That they uſe their Slaves with a moſt
barbarous cruelty. Their Veſſels reſemble in ſhape
our Gallies, and are generally manned with five or
ſix hundred men; they call them <hi>Paros,</hi> and run
with them all along the <hi>Indian</hi> Coaſt, even as far
as the Red Sea. They very rarely attack any <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi>
Veſſels, eſpecially if they be of any defence,
and if they happen to take any, it is commonly
done by ſurprize, ſeldom by open force.</p>

                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57955:74"/>
If theſe Corſairs render the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
troubleſome, it is very ſafe travelling by
Land, eſpecially, if you be conducted by ſome
<hi>Nahers,</hi> as you travel from one Town to another;
for robbing upon the High-way and Stealing, is
moſt ſeverely puniſh'd, whereas Pirating is look'd
upon as a free Exerciſe, the Kings in thoſe parts not
taking Cogniſance of what is tranſacted upon the
open Sea, where they are perſwaded the weakeſt
ought to ſubmit to the ſtrongeſt. Theſe Corſairs
pay the tenth of what Booty they take, either in
Money or Slaves to the Prince, under whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
they live; upon the Seas nothing is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their attempts, they attacking all they meet,
without any reſpect of Religion or Nation, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the leaſt regard to any paſſes, though given by
ſuch Lords or Princes as they ſtand in awe of.</p>
                        <p>If their next Neighbours or their beſt Friends
chance to fall into their hands at Sea, they ſpare
them no more, than if they were the greateſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the World, but load them with Irons till
they have paid their Ranſom. Theſe Pirats are
more ignorant and barbarous than the other Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
they are diſtinguiſhed from the Pagans on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by their Beards, Turbants and Veſts.</p>
                        <p>If they happen to take any Mahometans or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
they only ſtrip them of all they find,
but ſeldom make them Slaves, unleſs it be a perſon
from whom they expect an extraordinary Ranſom.
The Chriſtians are treated with more ſeverity, and
are ſure to die in Slavery, unleſs they be either ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed,
or elſe embrace Mahometaniſm, when they
are much reſpected, and commonly are made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

which falls into the Sea not above 100 Paces

Degrees and a half North Latitude, a League diſtant
from <hi>Tremapatan,</hi> 3 Leagues from <hi>Cananor,</hi> and 4
from <hi>Batiepatan</hi> to the South. There is a Houſe
Built according to the <hi>Indian</hi> Faſhion, of Wood
and Earth, upon a riſing Ground, in the midſt of
an Orchard, containing betwixt 2 and 300 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe-Trees;
and ſomething lower there is a large

ſurrounded with a ſmall Ditch. To the Land ſide,
there is a ſmall Market-Town, Inhabited by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
who have there a Moſque, which is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
Built and as pitifully maintain'd, where the

there are ſeveral Habitations of the <hi>Moncovas,</hi> or

                        <p>No ſooner were the <hi>French</hi> put in poſſeſſion of

the violence of the Symptoms, which to
me were no good Preſages, promiſed to Cure him
in 3 days time, and in part he made good his
Word, for having given him a certain Medicine,
which, as far as I could judge was a Compoſition
of Opium, (by the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Amphion,</hi>) of Oyl,
and of <hi>Jagra,</hi> or Sugar of the Cocoes, of which,
he was to take a Spoonful every Night and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he put an end to his Diſtemper and Life on

we were deprived of the greateſt Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

forced to ſubmit to Providence, ſo the Memory of

                        <p>The better to ſecure our ſelves and the Effects

at that time not at leiſure to come in Perſon, the

at laſt after various obſtacles to be ſurmounted,

ſet up ours, and an Enſign of theirs being ſent

a Ship belonging to our Company, Commanded

a Merchant of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was ſent into the

The ſight of this Veſſel, and the Arms which

Guides, and guarded by ſeveral <hi>Nahers.</hi> Our whole
Equipage conſiſted in no more than a Shirt and a
pair of Drawers; on our Feet we wore a kind of
Sandals, and to keep off the Rain, we were each of
us provided with an Umbrello, made out of the
leaves of Palm-trees.</p>
                        <p>The firſt days Journey proved extreamly trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
being obliged to march all day long through
the Waters that had over flown the Roads, which
in ſome places came to our middle, ſo that we were
not able to travel above two Leagues the whole day;
at Night we took up our Lodgings which were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enough, in a ſmall Market-Town, where we
dryed our Cloths without much difficulty, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of Callicoe. Thus after a miſerable Nights
Lodging, we continued our Journey the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we were refreſhed with a ſmall interval
of fair Weather, which however laſted but a few
hours. As we were marching through the Waters,
we were extreamly peſtered with Horſe Leaches,
which faſtned themſelves in great numbers to our
Legs, and fatigued us to that degree, that being
quite ſpent by Noon, we were forced to take up our
Quarters at the Habitations of ſome Mahometans.
In the afternoon the Sieur <hi>de Flacour</hi> paid a viſite to
the <hi>Naher,</hi> who though a Subject of the King of
<hi>Cananor,</hi> was Lord of the place, and without
whoſe conſent we could not paſs, which we eaſily
obtained by the means of a preſent. The next day
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57955:81"/>
we found the Road ſome-what better than we had
done hitherto, but another misfortune abated much
of our ſatisfaction; for after we had travelled near
four hours, we found our ſelves, being miſled by
the ignorance of our Guides, near the ſame place
from whence we ſet out in the Morning. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
anger would have ſtood us but in little
ſtead with thoſe, who had us at their Mercy, and
in whom we were obliged to confide as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors,
ſo that patience was the beſt remedy we
could preſcribe our ſelves, and thus we continued
our Journey in hopes of better luck. But we found
our ſelves ſoon deceived in our expectation, for we
had not travelled far, when the Rains began to be
more violent than ever, beſides that we travelled
all over ſtony Grounds full of deep and large
Ditches, which we were forced to paſs over ſmall
Planks or pieces of Trees laid a croſs. Armed with
Patience, and an unſhaken Reſolution to overcome all
Obſtacles, we at laſt came to a Market-Town, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by Mahometans, ſituated near a River
which runs by <hi>Cognaly.</hi> We were kindly received
by the Inhabitants, and the great Rains and paſs'd
fatigues, obliged us to reſt there for one day.</p>
                        <p>But, what we had ſuffered hitherto, was all it
ſeems nothing in compariſon of what we were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undergoe for the future; the Dangers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
which were repreſented to us by theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,
made ſo lively an impreſſion upon me,
that I earneſtly requeſted the Sieur <hi>de Flacour</hi> not to
go further, and though every one there preſent was
of my Opinion, and gave himſelf freſh aſſurances of
the dangers and troubles he muſt undergo, he ſtood
firm in his reſolution, to proſecute his Journey, in
order to diſpatch his buſineſs before the return of the
Sieur <hi>de Caron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for my part, I being not under any further
obligation, than to bear the Sieur <hi>de Flacour</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I thought it raſhneſs to expoſe my life to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
without any proſpect of doing good; ſo that I
reſolved to quit the Sieur <hi>de Flacour,</hi> and to take the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57955:82"/>
conveniency of a ſmall River, which diſcharges it
ſelf not far from hence into the Sea.</p>
                        <p>According to this reſolution, I hired a <hi>Canoe</hi> or
Boat, refuſing to accept of the Fire-arms that were
offered me, becauſe I did not imagine I ſhould have
any occaſion for them, being in hopes to reach and
lodge that Night at <hi>Bargara,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Couleas
Marcal,</hi> a rich Mahometan Merchant, and famous
Pirate in thoſe parts, with whom I had ſome Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I paſſed without any hindrance, (having
only the Maſter and his Boy in my Company) by
<hi>Cotta</hi> or <hi>Cognaly,</hi> a Market-Town, from whence
the moſt famous Pirate in thoſe Seas, whoſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
it is, derives his Name; and thus being gently
conveyed by the current, I thought my ſelf out of
all danger, as being near <hi>Bargara,</hi> when ſome Pirates
who had diſcovered me from far of, were making
towards me with their Boat. As I was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that all what theſe Barbarians lay hold on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Water, they look upon as their own; we
made the beſt of our way to the ſhoar, but ſcarce
had we reach'd the Bank, when we perceived the
Pirates at the heels of us, which ſo terrified both
the Maſter of the Boat, and his Boy, who carried
my Portmantle, that they look'd for their ſafety in
the ſwitneſs of their heels, leaving me to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of thoſe Robbers, who purſued me cloſely, till
they overtook me. I now began to repent my ſelf
of having refuſed the fire-locks that were offered me,
one of which would have been a ſufficient defence
againſt a couple of cowardly Rovers, who had no
other Arms,<note place="margin">The Author taken by a <hi>Malabar</hi>

any Arms, they ſoon knock'd me down, and
ſeeing there were no Witneſs of the violence offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me by Land, they forc'd me into their Boat,
and carried me back to <hi>Cognaly.</hi> As I was the firſt
of our Nation who had the misfortune to fall into
their hands, ſo I was conducted before their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
who uſed his utmoſt endeavours to extort from
me a Summ of Money for my Ranſom; but having
anſwered him that I had none to give, he asked me
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57955:82"/>
for what reaſon I had quitted the Sieur <hi>de Flacour,</hi>
and whether in his return he was to paſs that way
through his Lordſhip; I told him, that I was not
able to give him an account, upon which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Irons to be brought in, which were laid
cloſe by me, ſo that I expected every moment to
be loaden with Irons.</p>
                        <p>But as good fortune would have it, this Chieftain
had heard ſomething of the late alliance concluded
betwixt us and the King of <hi>Samorin,</hi> whoſe Subject
he was, which conſideration together with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſeverity, uſed againſt ſuch as commit Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
on Land, or in a River, had ſo good an effect
upon him, that he ordered the Irons to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and when I expected it leaſt, turned the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
man in the World, offering me his Houſe and
every thing elſe for my conveniency.</p>
                        <p>But as I was eager to ſee my ſelf at Liberty,<note place="margin">Is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> ſo I
returned him thanks for his offers, deſiring him to
give me leave to go ſtreight to <hi>Bargara,</hi> pretending
that I had buſineſs of great moment to tranſact
there that Night. He having granted my requeſt,
and ordered a Veſſel to be got ready, he preſented
me in the mean while with ſome ſweet Meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
which I took a few for Decency's ſake, but did not
eat any of them for fear of Poiſon, though at
the ſame time it muſt be confeſſed, that Poiſon is
leſs known among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> than any other
Nation.</p>
                        <p>After I had taken my leave of the Pirate, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Veſſel which was to carry me to <hi>Bargara,</hi>
where I was no ſooner arrived, but I met with the
ſame <hi>Canoe,</hi> which had left me before in the lurch,
the Maſter pretending that he had ſtay'd for me
there in hopes of my coming. But what rejoyced
me moſt was, That a certain Fiſherman told me,
that there was very lately a <hi>Frenchman</hi> arrived in
this Market-Town. You may imagine, that I made
all the haſt I could to find him out, and meeting
with my old Friend the Sieur <hi>de la Serine</hi> the Elder,
who was lately returned from <hi>Calicut,</hi> this happy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57955:83"/>
meeting was no ſmall comfort to me, for what I had
ſuffered during this troubleſome Journey, of which
and the laſt adventure, I gave him an exact relation.</p>
                        <p>He having already ſettled matters with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſair
who is Lord of <hi>Bargara,</hi> we travelled the next
day together to <hi>Tilcery,</hi> which being not above three
Leagues from thence, we arrived there before
Noon. There was ſcarce any body but was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at my ſudden return, but at the ſame time,
approved of my Reſolution, of not expoſing my

among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Samorin</hi> was
in former Ages of no greater extent than you

                        <p>It is Situated under the Eleventh Degree of North

Formerly it was the Chief place of Commerce of
all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and though it be much declined from
its Ancient luſtre, yet its Inhabitants are generally
very Rich, and moſt of them Merchants. This
was the place where the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> firſt ſet foot on
Shoar, after their firſt Diſcovery of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
Their King who at that time kept his Reſidence in
that City, received them with a great deal of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and reſpect, granting them a conſiderable ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
in his Territories, but they were ſo far
from making a ſuitable return to his Civilities,
that they began to Lord it both over him and his
Subjects, ſo that the King thought himſelf obliged
to rid his Hands of theſe bold Gueſts; whom the
<hi>Samorins</hi> drove out of their Territories, and never
ſuffered them to re-ſettle there ſince.</p>
                        <p>All about <hi>Calicut</hi> there are very low Grounds,

a year but ſome part or other of this Kingdom is
laid under Water, by the overflowing of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

had Built at a good diſtance from the Shoar, may
now be ſeen 2 Leagues deep in the Sea, above
half under Water,<note place="margin">The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Fort.</note> ſo that you may frequently ſee

tho' of different Nations, pay a great deal
of Civility to one another upon all occaſions, and
as it would have been look'd upon by them as an
Affront, if we had not ſtopp'd at their Habitation
as we paſs'd that way, we took up our Lodgings
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who Entertain'd us with all the
Civility imaginable, and we ſtaid with them much
longer than we at firſt intended, by reaſon that a
<hi>Paros</hi> of the Coſairs waited for our coming out of

                        <p>Having ſtaid for ſome time in hopes of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

our Patience, and being reſolved to run the
hazard, we rowed out of the Port in the middle
of the Day, but kept near the Shoar, in order to
Land if they ſhould come to Attack us. But as
theſe Cowardly <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſeldom Attack any but
whom they believe either not to dare or to be able
to cope with them, our reſolute Behaviour put
them to a ſtand, ſo that imagining us to be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than we were, they had not the Courage to come
near us. But this was not the only danger that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us, for we had not gone much further when eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57955:87"/>
another Veſſel riding at a good diſtance from us
near the Shoar, put us into a great conſternation; our
<hi>Nahers</hi> and Mariners having aſſured us that it was
without the leaſt doubt a Corſair Ship, we entered
upon a Conſultation what to do at this emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
whether it were not the ſafeſt way for us to get
a-ſhoar, and ſtay there till the Corſair had quitted
the Road, or for us to go ſtraightways on Foot to
<hi>Tanor,</hi> and let our Veſſel take the conveniency of
the Night to eſcape the Pirate. But there being no
Houſes at any reaſonable diſtance from the Shoar,
we did not think fit to put this Project in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ſetting the beſt face we could upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
rowed as near the Shoar as we could in the
ſame manner as we had done before; and thus
with our Arms ready to receive the Pirate, if he
ſhould come to Attack us, we paſs'd unmoleſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                        <p>
                           <hi>TAnor</hi> is the principal Town of a petty Kingdom,
which has given it its Name; it is 5 Leagues
diſtant to the South from <hi>Calicut.</hi> It wants the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of a River, the Ships that are bound to
this place being obliged to ride in the Road where
there is tolerable good riding, but only in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
The Inhabitants of the place are <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Merchants, who, moſt of them are very Rich.
On the very Sea ſide there are two ſmall Towns
Inhabited by Fiſher-Men, whereof thoſe of one
are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> thoſe of the other <hi>Pagans.</hi> Near the
firſt of theſe two you ſee a ſmall Church ſtanding
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57955:88"/>
in a Church-Yard, where ſtands a very high Croſs.
The King of <hi>Tanor</hi> keeps his Court at about a
League's diſtance from thence, his <hi>Mahometan</hi> and
<hi>Pagan</hi> Subjects living under the Juriſdiction of a
Governour of his, who has not the leaſt Authority
over the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are under the Government
of him that has the overſight over the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Church, which has long ſince been in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Jeſuits, who from time to time ſend
hither their Miſſionaries, to labour in the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Idolatrous people to the Chriſtian Faith.
He that was there at the time when I paſſed that
way, was called <hi>Matthias Fernandez,</hi> who having
lived there for theſe 7 or 8 Years together, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well verſed in the Language of the Country.</p>
                        <p>Tho' the whole Kingdom of <hi>Tanor</hi> be not above
8 or 10 Leagues long, and as many broad, yet is
their King as Abſolute as any in <hi>Malabar,</hi> not being
Tributary to any other. He has always kept a very
ſtrict Alliance with the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and theſe have
been as careful to maintain a conſtant good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
with him.<note place="margin">King of <hi>Tanor</hi> is an Enemy to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                           </note> The differences which were
then betwixt us and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> being riſen to
that pitch, that we expected nothing elſe but to
come quickly to an open Rupture, and this Prince
having always been a Mortal Enemy of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
we endeavour'd by all means poſſible to gain his

are extreamly Fertile, the Air is very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
there is great plenty of Fiſh and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

is for the moſt part Fiſh, unleſs it be ſome
perſons much advanced in Years, who eat Fowl and
ſometimes a Kid, Beef being look'd upon by theſe
as well as the other <hi>Pagans</hi> as a forbidden Fruit.
After we had diſpatched our Buſineſs at <hi>Tanor,</hi> we
Travelled by Land to <hi>Calicut,</hi> whither we had ſent

where beſides the Merchants there live a good
number of <hi>Tives.</hi> It lies on a River capable of
bearing Ships of 100 Tuns Burthen, but is ſo
peſtered with Pirates, that it is not very ſafe for
Merchant-Men to enter here. We being lodged
at a <hi>Tive</hi>'s Houſe, we had the opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them perform one of theſe ridiculous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
uſed among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> for the Recovery

                        <p>A Nephew of our Hoſt much Beloved by him,
was fallen dangerouſly ill of a Fever, and in ſpite
of all the Remedies that were uſed by his Unkle,
(who had left nothing unattempted which might
conduce to the Recovery of his Health,) was by
the violence of his Diſtemper reduced to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that his Life was deſpaired of. All other
Remedies having proved ineffectual, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the Myſterious Superſtition of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and having ſent for the <hi>Bramans</hi> belonging
to the next Temple, to try their Skill with the
Patient, they ſent one of their Number, who began
the Ceremony with crying ſilence to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57955:89"/>
After this he ordered a large Wooden Bowl to be
brought to him, which was laid all over the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
with Leaves; into this he put ſome freſh <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,</hi>
ſome dry'd, ſome <hi>Bananas,</hi> ſome <hi>Jagre,</hi> or
Sugar of the <hi>Cocoes,</hi> ſome boil'd Rice, and ſome
broil'd Fiſh, beſides a good cup full of <hi>Tary,</hi> or
Palm-tree Wine. The <hi>Braman</hi> put in every thing
with his own hand, muttering out certain Words,
and making moſt extravagant and ridiculous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.
Round the great Bowl he ſtuck many Wax
Candles lighted, and betwixt each of them a ſtick
of the ſame thickneſs tied all round about with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Then the <hi>Braman</hi> fell to his Prayers, which
being ended, he called to one of the Standers by,
who gave him one of the lighted Wax Candles,
which he put in his Mouth. This was no ſooner
done, but he appeared to be all in a Rapture, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
moſt ſtrange Poſtures and Faces, this being the
very nick of time, when they believe him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired,
and look upon what he pronounces, as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
whether the Patient be to live or die. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, this Devil happened to be none of the
moſt skilful; for he foretold that the young Man
ſhould recover his Health, which proved quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for he died in a few days after.</p>
                        <p>We went the next day from <hi>Chali,</hi> and arrived

I reſolved with another Friend of mine to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to learn if poſſible ſome News out of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and from <hi>Suratte;</hi> we entred the River of <hi>Batiepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
before Noon, and came up as high as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Houſe by that time they were juſt going to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory of <hi>Batiepatan,</hi> is above
a League and a half from the Sea-ſide, built upon
a riſing Ground juſt on the very River-ſide, which
will not bear any Ships of Burthen. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Commiſſary, and the Captains there preſent, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
us very handſomely, ſo that we ſtaid there
all the reſt of the day; our Mariners having in the
mean while refreſhed themſelves, and fearing if
we ſtaid any longer, we ſhould be hard put to it
with drinking; we parted at Night, and came ſafely
the next Morning to <hi>Tilcery,</hi> where, in a few days
after, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> return'd us the viſit.</p>
                        <p>But as theſe diverſions were but very rare among
us, ſo I began to be weary of this kind of Life,
which had made me write ſeveral times to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
of our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to deſire them
to remove me from <hi>Tilcery,</hi> being fully reſolved to
leave it without their permiſſion, if in a little time
I did not receive a favourable anſwer.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while we took another Journey to
<hi>Tanor,</hi> where we heard the news of the death of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57955:90"/>
the young <hi>Tive,</hi> of whom I ſpoke before, to have
been cured by the <hi>Braman.</hi> We only ſtay'd here
for a few days, when having diſpatch'd our buſineſs,
we return'd to <hi>Tilcery</hi> by Sea.</p>
                        <p>As it is very dangerous to coaſt it along the ſhoar,
by reaſon of the great number of the Corſairs, that
are watching thereabouts for pray, we put out to
Sea, where they are not ſo frequent. But ſcarce
had we ſail'd a League, when we were on a ſudden
over whelmed with ſuch an infinite number of Fiſh,
as big as our Mackerel, which threw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Veſſel, that the diverſion we took at it at firſt
ſight, not long after turned into fear of being ſunk
by their weight. We were fain to ſet all hands to
work to throw them out as faſt as poſſibly we could,
which however would have ſtood us but in little
ſtead, if we had not avoided the danger, by making
towards the ſhoar with all ſpeed we could. Having
rid our ſelves thus of our unwelcome Gueſts, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
only by their number we put to Sea again
a ſecond time, and arrived at <hi>Calicut</hi> about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
                        <p>We entertained the next day the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with all

truſting to the skill of our Mariners, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

way, through which one may ſafely enter the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
We expected every moment to have been

our reſpects to the Governour <hi>Cojabdalle,</hi> of whom

He had been accuſed of Extorſions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Malverſation, whereupon, having been Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
to appear before his Prince, he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd

for ſome time; but having at laſt found
means to juſtifie himſelf againſt theſe Aſperſions,
the King his Maſter had reſtored him to all his
Offices and Dignities he enjoyed before his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
The diſcontent occaſioned by his late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
might eaſily have been read in his Face, when
we ſaw him, notwithſtanding which, he received
us with a great deal of Civility; telling us, that
it was a great diſſatisfaction to him to ſee our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>

was Governour, and to ſee them tranſport it to
any Port where he had no Authority, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

of the beſt Quality, not excepting the Vice-Roy

this Fraternity, who Celebrate two great Feaſts
every Year.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Holy-Thurſday,</hi> becauſe on that day our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gave to the World the moſt evident proof
of his Humiliation, when he waſh'd the Feet of
the Apoſtles; and the other is Celebrated on the
day when the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to viſit her Couſin;
this laſt is performed with more Solemnity than
the firſt, and as they go in Proceſſion, they wear
a kind of Black Surplice.</p>
                        <p>The next day after the laſt Feaſt, the whole

Firſt they have a Prior, whom they call <hi>Prouve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;</hi>
formerly none but Noblemen were choſen
to that Dignity, but of late the Rich Merchants
are choſen as well as the Noblemen. All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
here are made for the Advantage of the
Poor, and there is ſcarce a <hi>Prouvedor,</hi> who at the
Years end does not contribute 20000 Livres of his
own. Beſides the <hi>Prouvedor,</hi> there is a Treaſurer
and Steward; a <hi>Prouvedor</hi> or Overſeer of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
all which, are choſen out of the Members
of this Society. The Treaſurer diſpoſes of the
Alms among the Poor, as the Overſeer of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
ſollicites their Buſineſs in cauſes both Civil
and Criminal, and often procures their Pardon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Prouvedor</hi> General's Office is to manage the
Buſineſs of the whole Society, to aſſiſt underhand
Widows, Orphans, and all others that are in a low
Condition. The Members of this Society are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to viſit the Poor and Sick, as alſo the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to Bury the Dead, to aſſiſt Criminals when
they go to Execution, and to give them what
Comfort they can even to the laſt Gaſp, and to
cauſe Maſſes to be ſaid for them after they have
ſuffered the Law. They chooſe every Year new
Officers, by which means, every one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
is in a probability of bearing his ſhare, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57955:97"/>
tho' all theſe Offices are chargeable, there's very
few but what are very eager after them.</p>
                        <p>Charity is the whole foundation of this Noble
and moſt Glorious Society; and there is ſcarce a
City, no not a Burrough of note, under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> but what has a Church

                        <p>THE Inhabitants of <hi>Goa</hi> may conveniently be

                           <note place="margin">Several ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in <hi>Goa.</hi>

and an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman, or a <hi>Negroe,</hi> the laſt of

are beſides this abundance of <hi>Indians,</hi> who having
Abandon'd their Superſtitious Idolatry, are turn'd
<hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> The Slaves they call <hi>Cafres,</hi>
who are moſt <hi>Indians.</hi> There are alſo at <hi>Goa</hi> ſome
<hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Banyans,</hi> who are tolerated by the
<hi>Portugueſes,</hi> by reaſon of the advantages they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from them, by way of Commerce. They
enjoy the ſame Freedom with the reſt, but are
not permitted to make publick profeſſion of their
Religion, which if they do, they are put under
the Inquiſition, and are treated like Chriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
                        <p>Perſons of Quality are carried in <hi>Palanquins</hi> by

unleſs it be upon extraordinary occaſions, as to
Conduct the Vice-Roy into the Country, or to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt

                        <p>The Slaves at <hi>Goa</hi> not wanting conveniency to
Deſert their Maſters,<note place="margin">Slaves at <hi>Goa.</hi>
                           </note> and to ſhelter themſelves in
the Adjacent Provinces, where they are out of
their reach, makes them not to be treated ſo harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as in ſome other parts, which makes theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
very unruly and inſolent. They frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rob on the High-ways, and tho' they are not
permitted to wear any thing elſe about them but
a Cane, yet they commonly knock Paſſengers on
the Head before they Rob them.</p>
                        <p>A certain Gentleman coming one day alone
from his Country-Houſe, near <hi>Goa,</hi> was ſet upon
by one of theſe <hi>Negroe</hi> Slaves, who threatned to
knock his Brains out if he did not immediately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
his Money and Cloaths. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
had a Sword and Dagger by his ſide, but the other
having ſurprized him unawares, and holding up
his Cane ready to ſtrike if he made the leaſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he found himſelf not in a condition to put
himſelf in a poſture of defence, without moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger of being killed. And finding no
other remedy than to ſurrender, he cunningly, but
in a careleſs manner, let drop ſome of his Money,
and whilſt the Slave was buſie in taking it up,
took this opportunity to draw his Dagger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he diſpatched him preſently.</p>
                        <p>It would be ſuperfluous to enlarge here upon the
Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too well known in theſe parts to deſerve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Deſcription. There are very few but what are
ſufficiently ſenſible that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in general
have theſe three Qualities belonging to them:<note place="margin">Genius of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes.</hi>
                           </note> To
be Zealous to the higheſt degree of Superſtition; to
be Amorous to a degree of Madneſs, and Jealous
beyond all reaſon. Neither will it appear ſtrange,
if the Ladies of <hi>Goa</hi> are as tractable and obliging
to handſome Men, as thoſe of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> 'Tis true,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57955:98"/>
they are watch'd as narrowly as is poſſible to be
done, but they ſeldom want wit to deceive their
Keepers, when they are reſolved to taſte of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Fruit; and they are the moſt revengeful
Creatures in the World, if they happen to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
in their Expectation.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but remember a certain Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
which hapned at the ſame time when I was
at <hi>Goa.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ladies of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                           </note> It ſeems a Lady of this City, had caſt her
Eyes upon a certain young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman,
who was at that time at <hi>Goa,</hi> about ſome Buſineſs
concerning their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company. Her Heart
being eaſily ſuſceptible of Love, the very firſt ſight
of this Stranger, had made ſo lively an impreſſion
upon it, that ſhe could not reſt ſatisfied till ſhe had
ſent one of her Female Slaves, (no novice in the
procuring Trade,) to deſire the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man to
give her a viſit; the Slave ſufficiently acquitted her
ſelf of her Charge, telling the Young Gentleman,
that he had the beſt opportunity in the World,
of taking his Satisfaction, her Lady's Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man overcome by
her intreaties and perſwaſions, promiſed to come
at the appointed time, at which ſhe being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
returned to her Miſtreſs to bring her the
welcome News that her Gallant would certainly
be with her according to her appointment.</p>
                        <p>The Lady being one of thoſe that cannot bear
delays without much impatience, made the poor
Slave ſtand Sentry two Hours before the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, to receive her Lover, and Conduct him
to her Apartment. But whether it was that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Man dreading the Jealouſie of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
did not think it worth his while to venture
his Life for a chance bit, or that ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
hindred him, he did not make his perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
according to his promiſe; ſo that the
poor Slave after ſhe had kept her poſt till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
return'd diſconſolate to her Miſtreſs, who
being put beyond all Patience, by reaſon of her
diſappointment, revenged her ſelf upon the Slave,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57955:99"/>
whoſe Back paid for all; and ſhe would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have felt the moſt direful effects of her fury,
if ſhe had not promiſed ſhe would go the next
Morning to find out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, to upbraid
him with the breach of his Word, and not to
leave him till ſhe had engaged him to comply with
her deſires.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Negroe</hi> Slave as it happened had the good
Fortune to meet with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, unto whom,
ſhe related in a moſt ample manner how ſhe had
been treated by her Miſtreſs, occaſioned by his
neglect or breach of Word, moſt earneſtly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him only to afford her Miſtreſs the favour of
one viſit, without which, ſhe would be in danger
of being torn to pieces by this paſſionate body.
He promiſed, out of Complaiſance, to come
very ſhortly to pay her a viſit, but perform'd his
promiſe no better than the firſt time, being obliged
to leave <hi>Goa</hi> in a few days after.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and <hi>Meſtices</hi> wear their Cloaths
in the <hi>Indies</hi> after the ſame manner as they do in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> except that they uſe no Stockings, their
Breeches reaching down to their Ankles, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to defend themſelves againſt the burning Heat
of that Climate.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Goa</hi> Ladies Dreſs is different from that
of the Ladies of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Their Dreſs.</note> They wear a kind of
half Smocks, of the cleareſt and fineſt Muſlin,
which ſerves more to keep them from being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
by the Flies, than to cover their Bodies.
They don't reach below the Waſte, and their
Sleeves come quite down to their Wriſts. Their
Petticoats are of fine White Callicoe, ſcarce co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
half their Legs, over which, when they go
abroad, they wear according to their Quality, ſome
Silk pieces of Stuff, which they wind twice round
them, and reaches down below their Ankles;
they don't wear Stockings no more than the Men,
and inſtead of Shooes make uſe of Slippers. They
are generally carried abroad in <hi>Palanquins,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appear at Church without a Veil, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57955:99"/>
their Face and ſome part of their Bodies; they
are debarr'd the Converſation of Men, unleſs it be
now and then with their neareſt Relations.</p>
                        <p>There is a great number of Clergy-Men in <hi>Goa,</hi>
but there are more <hi>Negroe</hi> Prieſts than the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi>
among them, they wear long Caſſocks, and
to all outward appearance live a very regular Life.
Every Monaſtery has its Houſe belonging to it,
where they diſpoſe of their Slaves; and I have
ſeen the Friars, during the exceſſive heat of the
Seaſon, Cloath themſelves in Taffata of the ſame
Colour, the Monks wear in <hi>Europe</hi> according to the
Inſtitution of their reſpective Orders.</p>

ſeeing us ſo reſolute ply'd their Oars ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

                        <p>No ſooner were we got a-ſhoar, but we were

valued at 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                        <p>Tho' the Prince <hi>Sevagi,</hi> the Lord of this Port,
was abſolutely in our Intereſt, yet all our Sea-Men
being <hi>Mahometans,</hi> except only three <hi>French</hi> Men,
we were very uneaſie about our Ship, for fear it
ſhould fall into the Hands of theſe Corſairs. Mr.
<hi>Petit</hi> the Captain had more reaſon to be concerned
than all the reſt, he having left his Ship to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar
in a place where he had no concerns on the
account of the Company; and to add to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
the Wind being quite contrary, we could
not get back again to the Ship.</p>
                        <p>In this extremity, the Captain took a reſolution
ſuitable to the emergency of our Affairs, which did
not admit of any delay; for which reaſon he got
into a ſmall <hi>Canoe,</hi> or Fiſher-Boat, and leaving
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57955:101"/>
us a ſhoar, was by two Fiſhermen happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted

                        <p>This <hi>Rhodomontado</hi> ſucceeded beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

The Winds proved very changeable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, our Voyage proved pretty ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
We came within ſight of the Cape of <hi>Raſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
ſituate on the South-ſide of the entrance into

                        <p>Here it was that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had formerly a

made them Maſters of the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulph;
this ſo advantageous place the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> loſt by the
avariciouſneſs of him who commanded in the Fort,
who having ſold the Proviſions laid up for the uſe
of the Garriſon, to the <hi>Arabians</hi> at an exceſſive price,
in hopes of receiving freſh ſupplies in a little time;
the King of the Country took hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,

remain ever ſince at Enmity with theſe <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but have hitherto not been able to recover the

                        <p>From hence we coaſted it along to the Cape of
<hi>Moſandan,</hi> where the Gulph begins to be ſo ſtraight,
that the Land appears on both ſides. Not far from
this Cape we diſcovered a Veſſel, after which, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant

to come up with her. But finding that ſhe avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

put up our Flag, when the Captain came on board
of us, and ſhew'd us his Paſs from the <hi>French</hi> Eaſt-India

                        <p>We came afterwards in ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>
and it being a miſty Morning, we took it for
that of <hi>Ormus;</hi> but we were ſoon undeceived as we
came nearer, and paſſed betwixt the two Iſlands of
<hi>Areque</hi> and <hi>Cevichemiche,</hi> near the laſt of which we
were forced to come to an Anchor, by reaſon of a
tempeſt that ſurpriſed us hereabouts. This proved
a moſt terrible Night to us, the Tempeſt being ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57955:104"/>
violent as to put us in fear of loſing our Anchors,
which if it had happened, we muſt have infallibly
ſplit againſt the Rocks.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner did day appear, but we left this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

and Beautified. It was formerly called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi>
and is Situate under the twenty ſeventh degree

peopled Cities in thoſe parts, where there is always

Foreigners Moſt of the <hi>Indian</hi> Ships touch in this

Commodities as are conſumed in <hi>Perſia;</hi> their
Houſes are built two Stories high, being flat and
Tarraſſed on the top with Summer Houſes, the
better to enjoy the benefit of the freſh Air. The
Streets are here very narrow, and their Market-places
not extraordinary large. People of Quality
divert themſelves in their Country Houſes built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

which time, few others but Merchants, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57955:104"/>
thoſe depending on them, are to be ſeen in the

                        <p>The Situation of this place is ſuch, as to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
not a little to the inconveniencies occaſioned
by the exceſſive heats. For juſt without the Walls
of the City, to the Eaſt, there are ſeveral high
Rocky Hills, from whence the burning rage of the
Sun reflecting upon the City and the Port,<note place="margin">Its Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> makes
the heats almoſt inſupportable. Beſides which, the
hot South Winds lay ſo continually upon the Port,
which choaks up the Foreign Mariners not uſed to
the Climate, abundance of whom die very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
                        <p>Upon theſe Hills there are vaſt quantities of the
Roſes, we call Roſes of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which open as ſoon
as they are put in Water, and ſhut again as ſoon as
taken out. The Mountains of <hi>Arabia</hi> lie on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the Gulph, which is not above eight
Leagues broad hereabouts.</p>
                        <p>There is not one fountain in this great City;
ſome Wells they have, but the Water is brackiſh:
So that they fetch all their freſh Water at a Leagues
diſtance from the Town. They have a certain kind
of Earthen Veſſels, in which they keep their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as cool as if it had been lately drawn from the
Spring.</p>
                        <p>The Ground about <hi>Baudar Abaſty</hi> is very Sandy,
and conſequently not very fruitful, but ſome
Leagues from thence, there grows moſt excellent
Wine, which they call <hi>Chiras</hi> Wine. They uſe
alſo another ſort of White Wine, which is made
in the Iſle of <hi>Quichemiche,</hi> where the Grapes are
without Stones.</p>
                        <p>Several of the <hi>European</hi> Nations have their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories

all Foreigners to Trade in.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> are all Mahometans, and ſo is their
Prince, but as there are abundance of Pagans alſo
in <hi>Perſia,</hi> they allow them the free Exerciſe of their
Religion in their Temples, and their publick Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
places. I met near this place with ſome of theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57955:105"/>
Trees, of which I have ſpoken before, to wit,
that they turn their Branches down-ward, and when
they touch the Ground, they take root immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:

not ſo low. Here are whole Mountains of Salt,
which by reaſon of their Whiteneſs, are ſeen at a

produce any thing for the conveniency or ſuſtenance

                           <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain, who formerly had been in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of our Company as a Pilot. We would
have detained him as our Priſoner, but ſhewing us
his Paſs, and a Diſcharge from the Directors of the
Company, we let him paſs without any further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation.
The Directors of the <hi>French</hi> Eaſt-India
Company at <hi>Suratte,</hi> being ſenſible of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the Ship the St. <hi>Francis</hi> was to our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
had ſent theſe three Ships to join us, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to ſail all together to the Port of <hi>Bombay,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
falling into the Hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet,

                        </p>
                        <p>There happened ſome difference betwixt the two
Captains of the St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and of the St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the
laſt of theſe two carrying her Flag on the main Maſt,
with orders from the Directors, for the other to take
down his ſo ſoon as they were joined; which the
Captain of the St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who had carried the Flag
all along, being unwilling to comply with, they
came to very high Words: But there being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity of obeying the Orders of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
the matter went no further.</p>
                        <p>Though we were continually peſtered with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Winds, yet did we on the Sixth of <hi>January,</hi>
paſs within ſight of <hi>Diu,</hi> where there is a <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Colony, which had been ſome years before pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the <hi>Arabians.</hi> For ſome days after, the
Wind blowing a favourable Gale from the North-eaſt,
we came within ſight of the ſhoar near <hi>Baſſaim</hi>
on the tenth.</p>
                        <p>Juſt at the Entrance of the Port of <hi>Bombay,</hi> there
lies a Rock, which ſtretching a Mile deep into the

reaſon we ſent for ſome Pilots, who conducted us
very ſafely on the <hi>12th.</hi> into the Harbour, which
is one of the ſafeſt in the World, provided you are
well acquainted with the Situation of the place, to
avoid the Rocks.</p>
                        <p>It was not many years ago in the poſſeſſion of

                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſince that time built there a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

have alſo laid the Foundation of a City, where they
grant Liberty to all ſtrangers of what Religion or
Nation ſoever to ſettle themſelves, and exempt them
from all manner of Taxes for the firſt twenty years.
We were treated here with abundance of Civility,
which we in part attributed to the good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>We ſent notice of our arrival at <hi>Bombay,</hi> to our

who was Beſieged by the forces of the King of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi>

                        <p>After my return from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Suratte,</hi> I received
Letters from my Father out of <hi>France;</hi> the bearer of
them was one Mr. <hi>Care</hi> a Clergy-man, who being
obliged to go ſtreightways to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to carry
certain Inſtructions to Mr. <hi>la Haye,</hi> from the Eaſt-India
Company out of <hi>France,</hi> from whence he was
come with all the expedition imaginable by Land,
he had left them with the Sieur <hi>Petit,</hi> who was to
deliver them to me.</p>
                        <p>The Sieur <hi>Baron</hi> was no ſooner gone for St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
but the Sieur <hi>Greton</hi> began to get his Equipage
in readineſs, in order for his departure into <hi>Perſia,</hi>

on the 20th day of <hi>February,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was noiſed about the Town that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet had been ſeen on that Coaſt. But before his

I diſpoſed every thing to quit <hi>Suratte</hi> with the firſt

                        <p>NOT long before my Arrival at <hi>Daman,</hi> the
Sieur <hi>de St. James,</hi> Son of a <hi>French</hi> Phyſician,
and another young <hi>French</hi> Man, were Married
there. The laſt of theſe two had Married the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard
Siſter of a Lady of Quality, called <hi>Donna Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronilla
de la Cerda,</hi> who, after ſhe was a Widow,
had Married a perſon of the firſt Rank among the
<hi>Portugueſes.</hi> The Sieur <hi>de St. James</hi> had Married
the Daughter of this Lady, whoſe Name being <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Roſa de Mello,</hi> was in all reſpects anſwerable to
her Youth and Beauty.</p>
                        <p>I having heard much talk of them at <hi>Suratte,</hi>
I thought my ſelf under an indiſpenſible obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pay them a viſit. But the firſt thing I did
was to deliver my recommendation to the Rector
of the Jeſuit College, who receiv'd me with all
the Civility imaginable, and conducted me to the
Governour, who after he had treated me according
to his Quality, propoſed to me to ſtay at <hi>Daman,</hi>
where there was at that time no other Phyſician,
but ſome <hi>Pagan Indians,</hi> whoſe Practice conſiſting
only in a few Receipts, they apply them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to all Patients. I return'd his Compliment,
deſiring ſome time to conſider of the matter; and
the Rector of the Jeſuits obſerving my inclination
to Travelling to be more prevailing with me than
the Proſpect of preſent advantages, urged me to
accept of the Governour's offers, aſſuring me, that
he would make uſe of all his intereſts for my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage.</p>
                        <p>The next following day I paid a viſit to my
two Country-Men, of whom I ſpoke juſt now,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57955:109"/>
they were overjoyed to ſee me, and Treated me
with a moſt Magnificent Collation; in the mean
while, the Sieur <hi>de St. James</hi> had ſpoke in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
to his Mother-in-law, to deſire her permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to let me Lodge in their Houſe, which ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eaſily granted, they had without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſent for my Trunks, ſo that when after ſome
Hours ſtay, I was going to take my leave, they
intreated me to accept of their Houſe, which at
their reiterated intreaties I could not refuſe to my
two generous Country-Men.</p>
                        <p>I was not ignorant of the Cuſtom of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
with whom you can ſcarce meet with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
circumſpection, in reſpect of the fair Sex, I
did not as yet mention one word concerning their
Ladies; but the next day they were the firſt that
mentioned and propoſed a viſit to them; I ſeem'd
to be careleſs in the matter, and having ſpent the
greateſt part of the day in viſiting ſome of my
Patients in the City, at my return towards Night,
they introduced me to them in their Apartments,
where I entertained them with the ſame freedom
as we do in <hi>France,</hi> whereat they ſeem'd not at
all diſpleaſed. They did ask me many Queſtions,
which I anſwered as well as I could, and <hi>Donna Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronilla</hi>
Addreſſing her Diſcourſe to me, above the
reſt, we did not part till late at Night.</p>
                        <p>I did not fail afterwards to viſit them at leaſt
once a day, and <hi>Petronilla</hi> treated me always with
more than ordinary Civility. She was of about
39 years of Age, notwithſtanding which, ſhe had
ſufficient Charms, being of a very pleaſing Aſpect,
of an admirable Shape, delicately featured and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
in all reſpects; ſhe had a very lively Eye,
and her Humour was the ſweeteſt and moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant

for ſome Hours every Night, and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

pauſes, the more paſſionately, as I ſuppoſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the Myſtery of the matter he was treating
of. The Women ſit in a Gallery by themſelves
at Church, and have Curtains drawn before them,
to avoid their being ſeen by the Men; but if
they are not ſeen they make themſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by their knocking their Breaſts, by their
Sighs and Groans, which they ſend forth as often
as the Prieſt ſays any thing that moves Compaſſion.
Nevertheleſs, there are many among them, who
make but ill uſe of this Holy-day, and under the
cloak of this affected Zeal, carry on their Intrigues.</p>
                        <p>After Sermon we ſaw the Proceſſion,<note place="margin">Proceſſion at <hi>Trapor.</hi>
                           </note> which was
preceded by ſeveral Penitents, who having their
Faces covered, and their Backs naked, did whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſo much eagerneſs, that the Blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the laſh. After theſe came the Inhabitants
of the place, each with a lighted Torch in his
Hand, and then the Prieſts. Immediately after
them was carried the Image, repreſenting our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
deſcending from the Croſs, which being
ſurrounded with about 20 young <hi>Negroes</hi> Mask'd
and arm'd with Lances, with a Captain at the
head of them, and ſeveral Drums and Trumpets,
made alltogether a very ſtrange Spectacle. For,
after they had taken a round in the City, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix
was Solemnly Interr'd in a Sepulchre prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for that purpoſe; and I muſt confeſs that this
Ceremony, which in other places, where the whole
is tranſacted with more decency, inſpires the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Devotion, did appear ſo ridiculous among
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in thoſe parts, that I could ſcarce
forbear Laughing my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>I went again to Church on <hi>Saturday,</hi> where I ſaw
nothing worth particular Obſervation. But on
<hi>Eaſter-Sunday,</hi> after I had been preſent at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
when the Holy Sacrament was carried from
the <hi>Jacobin</hi> to the Pariſh Church, I heard there a
Sermon, which being the oddeſt I ever heard in my
Life, I cannot forbear mentioning ſome paſſages of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57955:110"/>
it here: The Prieſt being come into the Pulpit,
and having made the Sign of the Croſs;<note place="margin">A pleaſant Sermon.</note> 
                           <q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
(ſaid he,) you cannot be ignorant, that
for three particular reaſons we always have a
Sermon on <hi>Eaſter-Sunday.</hi> The firſt is to wiſh
a Merry Feaſt to the Congregation; the ſecond
to put you in mind of my <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eggs; and
the third, to tell you a Merry Tale to make you
Laugh. Not to recede from my former Cuſtom,
and to give you all due ſatisfaction as to the firſt
point, I wiſh you all Merry <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days;
as to the ſecond, I can aſſure you, that if you
will be pleaſed to ſend me ſome <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eggs I will
not refuſe them. And as to what concerns the
third, I will only tell you, that I met yeſterday
our Fatgutted <hi>Gregory,</hi> and what do you think I
ſaid to him? I asked him whether he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
act the Perſon of <hi>Pilate</hi> in the Paſſion of
our Saviour.</q> With this he left the Pulpit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
as much as imparting the Benediction to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
who Laugh'd out aloud, that you might
have heard them at a conſiderable diſtance.</p>
                        <p>I paſſed the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days with a great deal of
ſatisfaction, which with the conſtant intreaties of
my Friends to ſtay me for ſome time longer, would
have been a ſufficient motive for me not to quit a
place, where I received daily new proofs of their
Affection towards me, if I had not been engaged
upon my part to the Governour, to return to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
after the Holy-days were over.</p>

                        <p>BEfore <hi>Donna Petronilla</hi> went to <hi>Trapor,</hi> ſhe had
done me the favour to introduce me into the
Acquaintance of Father <hi>John de St. Michael,</hi> Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

ſo generous as to give me a Letter of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,

thing that might be in his power. I had left my
Trunks and other moveables with him, when we
departed for <hi>Trapor,</hi> ſo that I was obliged to make
my firſt viſit to him, and to fetch away my Trunks;
but the Father had the goodneſs to engage me to
ſtay with him, till ſuch time as I had taken a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
whether I would ſettle at <hi>Daman,</hi> and if not,
till I ſhould have taken a full view of all the Town,
to ſatisfie my Curioſity.</p>
                        <p>I remain'd with him thus 14 or 15 days, being
at a great uncertainty what to reſolve upon, till
at laſt being overcome by the Civilities and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

who made me very advantageous offers,
I thought I ought not to refuſe the kindneſs of my
Friends, who ſhew'd themſelves the moſt Zealous
promoters of my concerns.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly I left the Convent, and having ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
my ſelf in a Houſe of my own, I choſe ſome
few Friends among the reſt of the Inhabitants,
with whom I might divert my ſelf at ſeaſonable
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57955:111"/>
times, when I was at leiſure from my Practice,
which needs muſt happen very often in a little place,
where I could viſit a good number of Patients in a
few Hours.</p>
                        <p>There was at that time a certain Lady of great
Quality, called <hi>Senhora Franciſca Sereira,</hi> living at
<hi>Daman,</hi> and one of her Daughters falling ill of a
violent and moſt dangerous Fever, I was call'd
to her, and had the good fortune to recover her,
which ſo deeply engaged the Lady in my intereſt,
that I cannot ſufficiently acknowledge her genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and muſt confeſs that ſhe was one main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
in making me ſtay ſo long at <hi>Daman</hi> as I
did.</p>
                        <p>For tho' I muſt confeſs that I received all the

and to make curious and new. Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
abroad over-balancing all other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I did at laſt reſolve to leave <hi>Daman.</hi> Purſuant

                        <p>The City of <hi>Baſſaim</hi> lies twenty Leagues South

                           <note place="margin">The City of <hi>Baſſaim.</hi>
                           </note> and is about four times longer. Their
Churches here are very Rich, and moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
Built, their private Houſes very neat and

It is ſurrounded with a Wall, but the Fortifications

                        <p>The greateſt conveniency belonging to this City,
is the River which waſhes its very Walls, and is a
ſafe Harbour for Ships of the greateſt Burthen at

fertile, and produce great ſtore of Rice.</p>
                        <p>Juſt without the Gates of the City is that famous
Church called by the <hi>Portugueſes, Noſſa ſenhora de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medio,</hi>
which being formerly a noted Pagan Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is ſince turned into a Chriſtian Church, where
due Reverence is paid to the true God. Upon the

Holy Virgin.</p>
                        <p>They relate that a Thief having caſt his Eyes
upon the rich Crown ſhe wears upon her Head,<note place="margin">An <hi>Indian</hi> Miracle.</note>
had hid himſelf in the Church, with an intention
to ſteal it as ſoon as the Church ſhould be ſhut up.
Accordingly the Villain approaching the Image,
was going to take off the Crown, but by a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Miracle, both the Robber and Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
immoveable in the ſame inſtant, in which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
he was found ſo ſoon as the Church doors
were opened. There is a part of the Fore-head,
(which they ſay is the place where he fix'd his
Thumb) which at a diſtance, ſhines as bright as a
Star, and as you draw nearer and nearer, it diſappears
by degrees, ſo that when you come to touch it, you
find nothing extraordinary in the matter.</p>
                        <p>This Image is in ſuch Veneration in thoſe parts,
that not alone the Chriſtians, but alſo the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans

three whole Years in this great City, of which I

                        <p>After this, ſome Affairs of moment happening,

hoped I would not refuſe the offer he would make
me, to take care of the Ship as a Phyſician, and
that I ſhould be honourably rewarded for my pains.
I return'd him thanks for his good Opinion, and
having accepted his offer, I was conſidered in the
quality of the Phyſician of the Ship.</p>
                        <p>We went on with a favourable Gale, till we
came under the Equinoctial Line, where we were
becalmed for a few days, when the Winds proving
again to our ſatisfaction, we continued our Voyage
with all the imaginable ſucceſs, till we came under
the thirteenth degree of Southern Latitude. There
it was that the Winds began to change continually,

We paſſed a great way to the Eaſt of the Iſle
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> and towards the end of the Month of
<hi>March</hi> came to the height of the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi>
where our Pilots had a mind to ſound the Coaſt,

then in the Eaſt, and conſequently very fair for

Week, and on the Holy <hi>Wedneſday</hi> grew ſo violent,
that we were forced to take in'moſt all our ſails, and
to make uſe only of- our fore-maſt Sail. The Sea
runs ſo terribly high, that our ſhip was toſſed moſt
violently; notwithſtanding which, we continued
our courſe, knowing-our ſelves to be far enough
from the ſhoar, to ſtand in fear of any ſiniſter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from thence. But on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning, the
Wind chop'd about to the Weſt,<note place="margin">Are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by a violent Storm.</note> and blew ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly,
that we began to be afraid of our Ship,
which though one of the ſtrongeſt that ever I ſaw,
let in ſo much Water, that two Pumps were ſcarce
able to throw it out as faſt as it came in. We chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
our courſe and run it before the Wind, which
continued with ſo much violence, that even the
moſt expert and moſt courageous of our Seamen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be afraid; but after a Storm which laſted
four and twenty Hours, the Wind veering about
to the Eaſt, we altered a ſecond time our Courſe,
and with a moderate Gale ſtood it in towards the
Cape, which we diſcovered on the Holy <hi>Saturday</hi>
early in the Morning. We were again becalmed
for ſome days, till the next day after the Holy Days,
when with a North Eaſt Wind we doubled the Cape
of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> but were not within ſight of it, being
afraid of being becalmed again if we did not keep
out at Sea.</p>
                        <p>We ſaw hereabouts ſeveral wracks of Ships which
we believed to have been loſt in the late Tempeſt.</p>
                        <p>Towards Night we diſcovered a Veſſel, which
ſteered a quite contrary courſe to us; but as they are

every thing to be got in readineſs, if there
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57955:114"/>
ſhould be any occaſion of Engaging an Enemy; but
the next Morning at break of day, we found them
at ſo great a diſtance from us, that we had all the

fighting at this time.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while,<note place="margin">Are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Scurvy.</note> we had a worſe Enemy
within our own Ship; this was that pernicious Evil,
the Scurvy, which in the month of <hi>April,</hi> began to
make a great havock among our Ships Crew, and
notwithſtanding all our Precautions, kill'd us ſome
of our Men every day: To add to our Affliction
we were often becalmed, till at laſt a favourable
Gale ariſing, we made towards the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi>
where we were to touch in our Voyage, ſo that on
the <hi>19th.</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> we diſcovered the ſhoar of
<hi>Braſil,</hi> near the Bay of <hi>All-Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some Fiſhermen who were out at Sea, having
diſcovered our Veſſel, came on board of us about
Noon, who undertook to conduct us ſafely into the
Road, but had almoſt loſt our Ship, ſhe ſtriking
upon the Sands, but as good fortune would have it,
ſo ſlightly, that it drew us into no further ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.
But we had all the reaſon in the World
to thank Providence for our delivery, a Ship of the
ſame bulk with ours having been loſt in the ſame
place ſome years before, ſo that ſcarce a Man eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with life, of a thouſand that belonged to the
Ship. But the advantage of a very fair Day and
Wind, joined with the indefatigable care of our
Mariners, made us by God's Providence eſcape the
danger, which threatned no leſs than our Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Being got clear of the Sands, we came to an
Anchor at a good diſtance from thence, and the next
day being the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> entered the Port and
caſt Anchor before the Town, which bears the ſame
name with the Bay. We had loſt five and twenty of
our Men in our Voyage from <hi>Goa,</hi> and had above
300 more on board, ſo terribly afflicted with the
Scurvy, that if we had been detained but never ſo
little a while longer at Sea, moſt of them would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly

other parts of <hi>Braſil</hi> are deprived of the advantage

reaſons for it; firſt, becauſe, ſay they, the Ground
is not fit for it; and ſecondly, which I look upon
to be the better of the two, becauſe that they are
peſtered hereabouts with ſuch prodigious numbers of
Ants, that they conſume the Grains before they take
root. Prillet and Rice grows in all parts of <hi>Braſil,</hi>
but the ordinary Food of the <hi>Braſilians</hi> is the flower

of <hi>Mandioc,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Caſſave,</hi> and the
<hi>Portugueſe, Farina de Rao.</hi> This <hi>Mandioc</hi> root is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by cutting of it in pieces, and putting them
into the Ground where they grow to a conſiderable
bigneſs; they are very White, and if they are eaten
unprepared, they prove often mortal. They take
away their venomous quality by ſteeping them in
Water, till they are ſoft, when they take them out,
and let them dry; this they repeat ſeveral times, and
ſo often, till they think them to be ſufficiently cured
of their ill Quality, when they make flower of it,
almoſt as courſe in outward appearance as Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
which at the beſt is but inſipid and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

which they call <hi>Bejous,</hi> they are of ſomewhat a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
taſte than the common Bread, but retain the

                        <p>They are furniſhed with Wheat from <hi>Rio de Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiro,</hi>

That the Native <hi>Braſilians</hi> are to this day, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
That they are much addicted to Witchcraft,
or at leaſt are reputed ſo to be; they are very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
have neither Temples nor Feaſts, and adore
the Devil. Their Hair they wear of a great length,
their Complexion is ſwarthy, they go Naked, are
naturally Brave and Nimble, and never forgive an
Injury. Their Arms are only a few Arrows,
which inſtead of Iron, are provided with a bone
of a Fiſh at the end; and if any of them make uſe
of Iron, they are ſuch as have got it by the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the <hi>Europeans.</hi> They are not unskilful
in Husbandry, but are more addicted to Hunting
and Fiſhing. They eat all ſorts of Fleſh, and as they
never lay up any Proviſions for future uſe, ſo they
endure Famine upon an occaſion with an unparallell'd
conſtancy. They are naturally Warlike, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at Wars with one another; ſuch of their
Enemies as they take Priſoners, they Fetter, and
publickly kill them,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Braſilians</hi> eat their dead Friends.</note> and ſo eat them. They don't
even interr their dead Friends, but devour them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſometimes before the breath is out of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
For if they judge their Friends paſt all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57955:116"/>
hopes of recovery, they kill them for fear they
ſhould grow lean before they die; and becauſe
they would husband their Dead Friends to the beſt
advantage, they dry their Bones, which they beat
to Powder, and make up in a kind of a pap, and
ſo eat it. When the <hi>Europeans</hi> upbraid them with
their Cruelties, they return us for anſwer, that we
are a Company of impious wretches, who ſuffer our

and in lieu of one Death, make them to
undergo what is a thouſand times worſe, I mean,

thither from <hi>Angola,</hi> and the <hi>Guinea</hi> Coaſt, their
chief Employment being to work in making of
Sugars, and Planting of Tobacco. They are
brought to Market in whole Droves, where they are
Bought and Sold no otherwiſe than we do our Cattle.
Thoſe who have great Plantations have ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of them at a time, who are under the tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of certain Commiſſaries, who are ſometimes more
cruel than their Maſters. Thoſe who have no
Grounds of their own, give their Slaves leave to
work where they can, provided they pay them a
certain Tax Monthly or Weekly. Thoſe who
work in their Maſter's Ground being uſed with ſo
much ſeverity, if they fail to perform their Task,
and the reſt being commonly overtasked by their
Covetous Maſters, this makes them Rob and Steal
where-ever they come in the Country, and being
reduced to deſpair, they often revenge themſelves
upon others for the Torments they are forced to
endure at home.</p>
                        <p>If theſe Vagabond Slaves render the High-ways

Some Enemies of the Young <hi>French</hi> Man who
envy'd his good Fortune, took an opportunity to
ſet a certain Gentleman, who had Married his

him, how unbecoming and little ſuitable it would
be to his Quality, to have a Brother-in-law that
was no more than a Chirurgeon, tho' he had aſſumed
the Title of a Doctor of Phyſick, and who perhaps
beſides all this might be a Heretick. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,

Ruffians into the City, where they found means to
get into the Houſe of his Siſter-in-law, and to
cut to pieces a certain Young Man, who bearing
ſome reſemblance to the Young <hi>French</hi> Man they
ſought for, and who had ſaved himſelf by flight,
pay'd dearly for it by the miſtake of theſe Villains,
who took the flight after they had ſatisfy'd their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
as they believed, for fear of being taken in
the Fact by the Neighbouring Inhabitants, who
were drawn thither by the moſt lamentable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
of the Women.</p>
                        <p>This Bloudy Action being come to the Judge's-Ears,
he ordered ſome Guards to be put in the
Young <hi>French</hi> Man's Houſe, to prevent a ſecond
Attempt, which they were reſolved to make, as
ſoon as they had got notice that they had miſſed
their aim.</p>
                        <p>The Young <hi>French</hi> Man finding himſelf thus in
danger of being Aſſaſſinated, took a reſolution to
leave <hi>Braſil,</hi> and to go to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,

The Wind veering about at the height of the
Cape of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> proved pretty favourable to us
till we came to Cape <hi>Verd.</hi> Much about the ſame
time it was we got ſight of the Iſle called <hi>Ferdnand
de Narogna,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The Iſle of</hi> Ferdnand de Narog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> having borrowed its name from the
perſon, who firſt diſcovered it. Formerly all the
Ships that paſſed this way, uſed to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with freſh Water in this Iſland, if they had
occaſion for any. But ſome ſtrangers having left
ſome of their Dogs behind them, theſe are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and become wild to that degree, that there is
no coming on ſhoar in that Iſland now a days.</p>
                        <p>As we came within ten degrees of the line,
the Wind began to be very changeable, and proved
ſoon after quite contrary to us, but it blowing a
pretty even Gale, we advanced by little and little,
till a moſt dreadful Tempeſt ariſing, drove us till
under the <hi>26th.</hi> Degree, where a great many of our
Ships loſt their Maſts and Sails.</p>
                        <p>But after having weathered it out,<note place="margin">Iſle of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera.</hi>
                           </note> we at laſt came
in ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Tercera,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi>
where they kept their King Priſoner for a
conſiderable time, and in all likelihood he would
have ended there his days, if they had not been
afraid that he might find means to get from thence.
It was on the twenty firſt of <hi>November,</hi> that we got
ſight of this Iſland, and if the Seas had not run ſo
high, we would have gone a ſhoar to refreſh our
ſelves; but as there is never a Port in the whole
Iſland, and that there is no ſafe Anchoring in the
Road,<note place="margin">Iſle of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
                           </note> we continued our courſe, and on the three
and twentieth, came in ſight of the Iſle of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
where abouts we ſtaid all that Night near the
Cape. The next Morning all our Ships ſent their
Chaloups a ſhoar to fetch ſome freſh Proviſions, but
did not come to an Anchor, that they might be in
readineſs to put to Sea upon all occaſions, the Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes
being ſo frequent here at this Seaſon, that
there is no ſafe riding for Ships.</p>
                        <p>The Iſles of St. <hi>Michael, Tercera,</hi> and ſome other
adjacent Iſlands, belong to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57955:121"/>
very fertile, affording great ſtore of very good
Wheat, which being from thence for the moſt part
tranſported to <hi>Portugal,</hi> they may well be called the
<hi>Granaries</hi> of that Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Our Chaloups being returned on the four and
twentieth at Night, we ſet ſail with a North Weſt
Wind, which did not laſt long, for all on a ſudden
the Wind chop'd about to the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tempeſt.</note> and from
thence to the South with ſuch violence, that this
tempeſt appear'd to me the moſt terrible that ever I
ſaw in my life. It continued thus for ten days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in ſo dreadful a manner, as is ſcarce to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed;
our Ship began to draw Water on all ſides,
and we ſaw before our Eyes nothing leſs than our
approaching death. We made all the ſignals of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
to the reſt by day, and by ſetting up our lights
by night, but in vain, the horrid darkneſs, but
above all the violence of the Tempeſt, had diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all our Ships, ſo that we found our ſelves alone,
having loſt all our ſails, except our Fore-maſt ſail.</p>
                        <p>We had nothing left to hope for, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
our ſelves to Prayers, and the whole ſhips crew
made their Vows to the Bleſſed Virgin, under whoſe
protection we at laſt eſcaped the danger. In the
mean while, every thing was in ſuch a confuſion, as
is eaſier to be imagined than to be expreſſed; the
Waves which riſe as high as Mountains, beating
continually over the Ship, which we thought would
have been ſwallowed up every moment in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
Abyſs. The approaching day rendred
every thing much more ſupportable, but the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
darkneſs of the Nights put us under ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of approaching death, that we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
deſpairing of ever ſeeing day again. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
which befell us the laſt Night, was the moſt
terrible of all, which put even the moſt couragious
into deſpair.</p>
                        <p>It is to be known, that we had ſome Top-maſts
and Yards in the Ship to make uſe of upon occaſion,
which were ſo well faſtned upon the Deck, that they
had not ſtirred hitherto. Our two Chaloups were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57955:121"/>
placed a top of them, one within the other, and in
the ſmalleſt of the two, there were ſome hogs,
which we had brought from <hi>Braſil,</hi> to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
of them in <hi>Portugal,</hi> they being of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſize. The moſt violent toſſing of the Ship,
for ſo many days together, had at laſt either looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or broke the Ropes, which had faſtned all theſe
things together, ſo that the Maſts, Yards and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops
rowling from one ſide to the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the motion of the Ship, and being thrown
againſt her ſides, we did not imagine otherwiſe but
that ſhe had been ſtaved to pieces; there was not
one in the Ship, but what was uttering forth his laſt
Prayers, expecting every moment to be the laſt of
his life.</p>
                        <p>We had Paſſengers and Mariners on Board of
us of ſeveral different Nations, each of them offering
their Vows and Moans in a different Language;
this made the moſt doleful noiſe that ever was heard,
which together with the darkneſs of the Night,
made every thing appear more dreadful than it was;
no body daring to go upon the deck for fear of
being cruſhed to pieces, as we found the Hogs to be
afterwards. At laſt, Day-light began to appear, the
moſt wellcome that ever was ſeen, and our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
taking new Courage with the approaching
light, faſtned the Chaloups and Maſts again; and
ſcarce were a few hours paſt, but the sky began to
clear up, the Sun rejoyced us with its moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Rays, the Winds began to abate their Fury, and
we ſaw our ſelves ſoon freed from the apprehenſion
of danger.</p>

                        <p>AFter we had ſpent ſome time in putting things
in order, and ſtopping the leaks occaſioned by
the late Tempeſt, we were cruiſing up and down,
often changing our courſe, to try whether we could
meet with any of our Ships, that were ſeparated
from us in the laſt Storm; but meeting with no
Veſſel that could give us the leaſt account of them,
we thought it our beſt way to direct our courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Port of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the Eleventh of <hi>December</hi> towards Evening,
our Sentinels diſcovered a ſtout Ship making up
towards us; which we believing to be an <hi>Algerine,</hi>
we were getting every thing in readineſs for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
defence, in caſe we ſhould be attacked by
theſe Corſairs. We continued in this Poſture, the
approaching Night having robbed us of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to be rightly informed, whether this
Ship were an Enemy or not; as ſhe put out her
Lights all the Night long, ſo we did the ſame,
to give them to underſtand, that we were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of them. Thus we kept in ſight of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
till next Morning, and each of us having
done the beſt we could to come up with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we ſoon found our miſtake, the Ship pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

I hope it may not be unacceptable, if I ſay
ſomething here as it were en paſſant, of a City, where

                        <p>The River <hi>Tagus,</hi>

This River is Situate under the 39th and 40th
Degrees of North Latitude. Its Entrance is to be

City, is always provided with a good Garriſon,
and has a Port capable of containing Ships of a
great Bulk, but they don't ride very ſafely here,
if the Wind blows hard at Weſt or South Weſt.
<hi>Caſcais</hi> is dignified with the Title of a Marquiſate,
belonging to one of the greateſt Lords of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Near this place is the Bar of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where
it is dangerous paſſing, if you are not provided

been loſt here for want of ſuch guides as were well
acquainted with this paſſage.</p>
                        <p>About two Leagues beyond <hi>Caſcais</hi> there are two
Forts;<note place="margin">Two other Forts.</note> one whereof is Built upon Piles in the

good Garriſons and a good Artillery, all the Ships

                        <p>Near this Caſtle upon the very Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

Anchor, to ſtay for their laſt diſcharge from the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57955:124"/>
Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe within the Adjacent
Caſtle. It is a very Populous place, and affords
all manner of refreſhment to ſuch Ships as come
there to an Anchor.</p>
                        <p>There is in this place a Convent belonging to
the <hi>Bernardin</hi> Friars, one of the fineſt in the whole
Kingdom. It is called <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> (having given
its Name to the Adjacent Caſtle, and the Town it
ſelf) being Conſecrated to the Memory of the
Birth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. It was Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> under whoſe

                        </p>
                        <p>On the other ſide of the River directly oppoſite
to the Convent of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> you ſee a very large
Structure, where ſuch Ships as come from any
places ſuſpected to be infected with the Plague,
are obliged to unload their Goods, and to keep
their Quarantain all along the River ſide. Betwixt

Houſes, which afford a very delightful Proſpect

                        <p>The Royal Palace is Built upon the very Bank
of the River. The grand Place-Royal faces this
Caſtle, called by the <hi>Portugueſes, Tereriro de Paco,</hi>
where they run at the Ring, and keep their Bull-fightings.</p>
                        <p>There are in <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſeveral good Market-places,
and other large and fine Squares; abundance of
ſtately Buildings, and a great number of Fountains,
which are to be ſeen all over the City, and ſerve
both for an Ornament to the City, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of the Inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> are very cautious in following
the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion in their Dreſſes. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Women are very little, but well ſhap'd. Ladies
of Quality appear abroad with their Faces unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
the reſt wear Veils, but they have a way
of opening them, when they have a Mind to be
ſeen.</p>

                        <p>AFter I had made the beſt Obſervations I could
concerning every thing I thought worth taking
notice of in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> I took Shipping in a Veſſel,
which was bound to <hi>Bayonne</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We weighed Anchor from before the Caſtle of
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> on the 22d of <hi>July,</hi> and the next day
got out to Sea; but the Wind turning about, and
it blowing very hard all the following Night, our
Mizen Maſt Split, ſo that we were forced to make
towards the Shoar to refit.</p>
                        <p>We came to an Anchor the next day in the Port
of <hi>Caſcais,</hi> where the Sieur <hi>Du Caſſo,</hi> an Inhabitant
of <hi>Bajonne</hi> and I went a-ſhoar, we continued there
till the 28th of the ſame Month, when we took
Shipping again, and got out at Sea a ſecond
time.</p>
                        <p>But the Wind Steering about ſoon after we were
fain to keep at a great diſtance from the Shoar;
ſo we doubled the Cape of <hi>Finiſtre</hi> the 4th of
<hi>August,</hi> and Sailed along the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> till
the 15th of the ſame Month, when we got ſight of
our Native Shoar, and at the ſame time of a Veſſel
that was making all the Sail ſhe could towards
us.</p>
                        <p>We having no more than 25 Men, and 6 Guns
on Board, we thought it our beſt way to change
our Courſe; but whilſt we were flying from our
ſuppoſed Enemy, we ſoon got ſight of another,
which made us alter our Reſolution, and to purſue
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57955:125"/>
our former courſe, which we did accordingly, but
ſo near the Shoar, that we might have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of running our Veſſel on Shoar, if we ſhould
be conſtrained ſo to do. Thus we Sailed all the
Night, ſurrounded with terrible apprehenſions both
of the danger of the Shoar and our Enemies, but
by Day-light ſeeing but one of the Ships that were
in purſuit of us the day before, and finding our
ſelves not far off of the River of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> we made
all the ſails we could, and happily entred it the
ſame Night. Thus after 10 Years Abſence, and a
Thouſand dangers and fatigues, the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of long Voyages, I had the ſatisfaction
to ſet once more foot on Shoar, the 16th day of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> in my Native Country, <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>VOmiting is the firſt inconveniency Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
are afflicted with at Sea, it is cauſed
partly by the motion of the Ship, partly by
the change of the Air.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting as common as it is, is ſometimes not
without danger. I have ſeen ſome people of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſtitution weakned by it to that degree, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57955:128"/>
they were in no ſmall danger of their Life, by the
great loſs of Spirits. Others I have ſeen, who for
3 or 4 Months together have not been able to ſtir
out of their Beds.</p>
                     <p>To prevent in ſome meaſure the violent Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at Sea, it is very convenient to take 2 or 3
proper Purges, a little before you go to Sea, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if you have not lived very regularly before.
When you are at Sea, you may mitigate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of it, if you keep your ſelf quiet betwixt
Decks, for the firſt 4 or 5 days of your Voyage,
but not to abſtain from Eating and Drinking, tho'
you ſhould bring it up again immediately after;
for, if you Vomit with a full Stomach, you don't
ſtrain ſo violently as you do when it is empty,
when violent Vomitings cauſe often very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Haemorrhagies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is of great moment, to feed at firſt upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is of very eaſie Digeſtion and good
nouriſhment, to drink but little Wine, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
as much as poſſible can be from Brandy or
Aqua vitae, it having been found by Experience
that ſtrong Liquors are ſo far from fortifying the
Stomach upon this occaſion, that they are rather
very hurtful.</p>

                     <p>THE Scurvy, call'd by the <hi>French</hi> Mariners,
the Land Evil, is the moſt dangerous and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
of all thoſe Diſtempers, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to thoſe that undertake great Voyages; it
being not only contagious, but alſo ſcarce ever to
be cur'd till you get aſhoar.</p>
                     <p>The general Cauſes of this Diſtemper are,<note place="margin">Cauſes of the Scurvy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Sea.</note> the
Sea Air, the Salt Proviſion, both which cauſe great
alterations in the Blood; Melancholy, occaſioned
by the tediouſneſs, and other Inconveniencies of
long Voyages; Thirſt, the common Companion
of thoſe who are to paſs into the Eaſtern-Parts,
and that commonly at ſuch a time when they ſtand
moſt in need of Refreſhment. And laſt of all,
the Naſtineſs of the Mariners, who ſeldom keep
themſelves clean and neat.</p>
                     <p>For which reaſon it is, that the Officers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
above the common Rank on board theſe
Ships, are not ſo much ſubject to the Scurvy as
the common Sea-men, becauſe they are better
provided with change of Linen, and feed upon
ſuch things as are of a better Digeſtion and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Symptoms of the Scurvy, appear moſt
commonly in the Mouth and Gums, which ſwell,
grow black, and emit a very ill Scent, ſo that you
are obliged to make very deep Inciſions, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to take away a conſiderable quantity of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Fleſh and Matter, which not only looſens
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57955:129"/>
the Teeth, but alſo often makes them fall out.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper diſcovers it ſelf alſo frequently
by certain black Spots,<note place="margin">Its Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms and Signs.</note> which appear upon the
Arms, Legs and Thighs, and laſt of all over the
whole Body; and it is to be obſerved, that, the
broader theſe Spots are, and nearer the Heart,
the more dangerous is the Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>This Corruption of the Gums, and the breaking
out into Blotches is commonly preceded, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow'd by a nauſeouſneſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
a Lazineſs by fainting and ſwooning Fits,
pains in the Head, Arms and Legs, and a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but ſeldom by any Fever, I having often
obſerved, that the Pulſe commonly appears very
little declining from its natural State and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Blood being (for Reaſons above-alledged)
rendred thick and terreſtrious, do's not circulate
freely in the leſſer Veſſels, which are ſpread in the
Gums, the extremities of our Bodies, and all
over our Skin; ſo that its motion ceaſing in thoſe
parts, they are depriv'd of their uſual ſupply of
Spirits; what wonder is it if the coagulated Blood
go's into a Corruption, from whence proceed
thoſe Tumors and Blotches; And as the ſaid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is augmented in proportion, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to other parts, the circulation of the Blood
is by degrees alſo obſtructed in the larger Veſſels;
from whence proceed thoſe violent Symptoms,
but eſpecially thoſe frequent Swoonings, which
are commonly the fore-runners of Death.</p>
                     <p>To prevent this <hi>Evil</hi> ſo deſtructive to Mariners,<note place="margin">Precaution againſt the Scurvy.</note>
the Officers, to whoſe management the Ship is
committed; ought, before their Embarquement
to take effectual care that their Ships be Victuall'd
with good and ſound Proviſion, that the Biſcuits
be not mouldy, or the Victuals tainted, which is
too frequently practiſed, to the great detriment
of the whole Ships-Crew, when either the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dares not contradict thoſe who have the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling
of the Ship, or when out of covetouſneſs
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57955:129"/>
he ſhares with others the Profits ariſing by this
Malverſation.</p>
                     <p>When they are out at Sea, the Officers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ship ought to be very careful to have

                        </gap>'d and ſweetn'd two or three
times a Week with good ſtrong Vinegar, which
purifies the Air, and renders it more ſubtil and
thin.</p>
                     <p>Each particular Perſon on board the Ship ought,
as far as is poſſible, provide himſelf with the Juice
of Citrons, Limons, Ros ſolis, preſerv'd and dry'd
Fruits, but eſpecially with good Store of Prunes;
to abſtain as much as can be, from all ſorts of
Meat, which are in the leaſt tainted, from Salt-Fleſh
and Fiſh, unleſs they be well freſh'd out; to
feed much upon Rice, Barley and Prunes, drink
Wine mix'd with Water, and not to abſtain from
drinking if you be thirſty, unleſs it be in caſe of
the higheſt neceſſity; to change frequently your
Linen, and to waſh often your Mouths and the
whole Body, to cleanſe it from all the Filth and
ill Scents, which are engendred by the continual
Sweats, and which hindring the inſenſible Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
do not a little contribute towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Scurvy.</p>
                     <p>But if a body be already ſeiz'd with this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diſeaſe, which will ſoon appear by the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and blackneſs of the Gums, no time ought
to be neglected to ſtop the progreſs of this Evil,
which in a little time will ſpread all over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
If it be in a plethorick and vigorous Body,
it will not be amiſs to lett a little Blood, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the circulation of the <hi>Blood;</hi> but this ought
not to be done in great quantity, for fear of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the Patient's Spirits, who in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

of a Remedy, which, as they believe, not being
ſufficiently approved by experience, appears
doubtful to them, though they judge the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
to be mortal, or incurable without it.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs it is obſervable, that by their long
experience they have made ſuch Obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
certain Diſtempers peculiar to thoſe
Countries, that they practiſe with better ſucceſs
than the moſt learned foreign Phyſicians, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certain occaſions muſt follow their footſteps,
if they expect to ſucceed in their Cures in this
Climate.</p>
                     <p>They never allow their Patients afflicted with
any kind of Fever in the <hi>Indies,</hi> neither Meat,
neither Eggs or Broath, this would be as much as
the Patient's life is worth, if they ſhould give
them any of theſe things. They allow them no
other Drink but fair Water, and for the reſt for
their ſuſtenance, they give them a <hi>Cange,</hi> which
is made in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>They beat about half a Pound of Rice in two
or three quarts of Water, which they boil ſo long,
till the Rice be well broken, which is commonly
done in an hours time. Then they ſtrain it thro'
a Linen-Cloth, and ſqueeze it well to draw out
all the goodneſs from the Rice; of this they give
a Spoonful at a time, four or five times a day to
the Patient, making it always warm, and putting
a little Salt into it, to make it the more ſavory.
I ſhall have occaſion to tell you anon, upon what
occaſion they put Pepper into this <hi>Cange.</hi>

alſo to ſquench the Thirſt; I muſt confeſs I prefer

now a-days in <hi>France,</hi> rather by the connivance
than the approbation of the Phyſicians.</p>
                     <p>For, is it not very ſtrange to ſee a ſick body to
take more Nouriſhment, whilſt he is ſick, than
perhaps he uſed to do when he was in Health? It
being beyond all queſtion, that Jelly-broath taken
perhaps ſeven or eight times a day, and new-laid
Eggs, which we give our Patients, contain more
Nouriſhment, and produce a greater quantity of
pure Chyle than a moderate quantity of Bread
and Meat, which is the ordinary Food of People,
when they are in good Health.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, the <hi>Cange</hi> has alſo this Excellency,
that it cauſes no averſion in the Patient, which is
the general Inconveniency in theſe ſtrong Broths,
which being taken with ſo much Repugnancy,
can ſcarce be ſuppoſed to produce any good effect.</p>
                     <p>If it be a continual Fever, they allow them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

they allow them betwixt the Fits, to eat a little
Bread and Sweet-Meats; But no kind of Meat or
Eggs, unleſs it be after the Ague has entirely left
them, and that there is no fear of a Relapſe.</p>

and that with good Succeſs; the <hi>Pandites,</hi>

twenty times one after another, without the leaſt
Reluctancy to be obſerv'd in the Patient, who
never grumble here at what their Phyſicians do,

beyond what is practiſed in moſt Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>

                     <p>They let blood moſt commonly in the Foot with

this Obſervation, not only in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but alſo
in all other places which I have viſited in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
as well as in <hi>France,</hi> that there are few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
where the letting of Blood in the Foot
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57955:133"/>
proves not more ſucceſsful than when done in the

                     <p>The <hi>Pandites</hi> perceiving the Urine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
that is afflicted with a Fever to be white,
they judge it to proceed from a cold Cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having the leaſt reſpect to the <hi>Delirium</hi> and
other Symptoms, which are the ordinary ſigns of
this Urine.</p>
                     <p>For which purpoſe they put Pepper in the

to warm the Brains, which, they ſay, are too
cold; and for the ſame reaſon it is, that they will
not let blood in ſuch a caſe, before they find the
Urine to be of a high Colour.</p>

Symptoms; of which, I cannot forbear to give
you an inſtance.</p>
                     <p>I liv'd at <hi>Daman</hi> for ſeveral Months, where,

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57955:134"/>
under my Cure the eldeſt Daughter of a certain
Lady of the beſt Quality in that place, in which
I had ſucceeded ſo well, that I receiv'd all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
imaginable from her hands. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
one of her younger Daughters being
fal'n dangerouſly ill of a continual Fever with a
<hi>Delirium;</hi> the Lady, upon the perſwaſion of a
certain <hi>Pandite,</hi> who had been a Phyſician to the
Family a great while, made uſe of his Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without letting me know any thing of the
matter; But finding her Child grow worſe and
worſe, ſhe ſent to me unknown to the <hi>Pagan</hi>
Phyſician, deſiring my advice concerning her
Daughter. It was the ninth Day, when I was
call'd to her, and finding her Urine of a whitiſh
colour, and the Fever very high with a violent
<hi>Delirium,</hi> I drew from thence far different Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to what the <hi>Pandite</hi> had done; and having
remonſtrated to her Mother the danger of her
Daughter, who was not above ſeven years of
age, I order'd her to be let blood immediately.
The <hi>Indian</hi> Phyſician hapning to come in the ſame
moment, maintain'd in my preſence, that the
Fever proceeding from a cold Cauſe, the young
Lady would infallibly die if ſhe were let blood;
but I laugh'd at the weakneſs of his Argument,
and my Advice prevailing with the Childs Friends,
ſhe was let blood, and I took from her head the
Pepper mixt with the <hi>Cange,</hi> of which there was
near half a pound, very finely beaten upon the
Childs head; I let her, in all, five or ſix times
blood, after which the Fever left her, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated
the Cure by giving her 2 or 3 Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
contrary to the expectation of the <hi>Pagan</hi>

infallible.</p>

and Looſeneſs; the Pulſe is ſtrong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Urine ſometimes red, ſometimes white,
but always clear; Theſe ſigns are not always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in one and the ſame Subject, but this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
being very acute, and making quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
it is not adviſable to ſtay till all of them
appear, but by ſome of them it is eaſie to gueſs
at the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and chief Remedy to be apply'd to
thoſe whom they imagine to be ſeiz'd with the
<hi>Mordechi</hi> is,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> to burn their Feet; This they do
with a red hot Iron of the thickneſs of a common
Roaſting-Spit, wherewith they touch the Feet
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57955:135"/>
of the Patient croſs the Ankles, in that part where
it is moſt callous, and hold it cloſe to the place,
till the Patient begin to cry out, and ſignifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that he begins to be ſenſible of the Pain, when
it is taken away immediately; which done, they
take a Slipper or ſome ſuch thing, and give two or
three good Stroaks upon the place, where the Iron
has toucht, which prevents the riſing of a Bliſter,
without any further Application.</p>
                     <p>This manner of burning with an Iron, as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
as it appears at firſt ſight, does not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to the place where it is apply'd; and I
have ſeen ſome walk as freely immediately after,
as if they had not been touch'd with any thing.
It is certain that this Remedy ſtops the violence of
the <hi>Mordechi,</hi> and oftentimes cures all its Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
in an inſtant; and if it happen that the
Fever continue ſome time after, it never proves
dangerous, and is eaſie to be cur'd by ordinary
Remedies.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo in theſe Fevers, that the <hi>Indians</hi> put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Pepper in the <hi>Cange,</hi> which they give
both inwardly to the Patients, and apply it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to their Heads, as we have mention'd it
before. And generally ſpeaking, it is only by
theſe means and burning under the Feet, they
cure this Diſtemper, without letting Blood,
which would infallibly prove mortal, if it were
made uſe of in the beginning of this Diſtemper.
Neither do they preſcribe any Purgations (if there
be occaſion for any) till after the moſt violent
Symptoms are ceaſed, and that there is no further
appearance of a Fever.</p>
                     <p>I don't in the leaſt queſtion, but that abundance
of People will look upon this Cure, which is
perform'd by burning the Feet, as ridiculous, and
not fit to be taken notice of, conſidering there
ſeems to be ſo very ſlender a relation betwixt the
Remedy and the Diſtemper, for which it is put in

into the <hi>Indies,</hi> I was of the ſame opinion, till
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57955:135"/>
being convinc'd of the truth of it by experience,

                     <p>DYſenteries of all kinds are contagious, not
eaſie to be cur'd, dangerous, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mortal, not only in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
on Ship-board.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> are no leſs ſubject to this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than the <hi>Europeans;</hi> but the latter are not ſo
eaſie to be cur'd as the firſt, by reaſon of their
Debaucheries in Wine and <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which is not
ſo common among the Eaſtern Nations.</p>
                     <p>If the Dyſentery has a Fever for its Companion
(which indeed it is ſeldom without) the <hi>Pandites</hi>
give to the Patients of their <hi>Cange,</hi> and ſome Rice
very thick boil'd, but without Salt; this they mix
with an equal quantity of curded ſowre Milk,
which they praiſe as the moſt ſovereign Remedy
in the Univerſe againſt this Diſtemper; But
I muſt confeſs that I never ſaw it made uſe
of, but it prov'd fatal; they let blood in this
Diſtemper and repeat it frequently; But they
don't make uſe of any Purgations, nay not ſo much
as of any Anodyne Clyſters, which they ſay, would
encreaſe the Evil, but in lieu of them they make
uſe of Aſtringents; which as they ſometimes ſtop
the <hi>Flux,</hi> without removing the Cauſe; ſo the
Patients by the violence of the Torments, are put
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57955:136"/>
under moſt intolerable Inquietudes, reſting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day nor night; To obviate this, they give
them <hi>Opium</hi> very plentifully, and that without
the leaſt Preparation, ſometimes ten Grains for
one Doſe.</p>
                     <p>It can't be deny'd but that the <hi>Indians,</hi> being
accuſtomed to the uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> they can bear a
much greater Quantity than the <hi>Europeans;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I can teſtifie it, I know very few that
have been cur'd by their <hi>Opium,</hi> as little as by their
other Remedies they make uſe of in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>But if this method commonly proves pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the <hi>Indians,</hi> it was certainly fatal to ſuch
<hi>Europeans</hi> as truſted themſelves to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of theſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Phyſicians; and I do proteſt
to you, that I never ſaw any <hi>European</hi> who was
afflicted with the Dyſentery, but what died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Hands.</p>
                     <p>I am apt to believe, that thoſe who rightly under
ſtand the pernicious quality of <hi>Opium,</hi> will give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to what I ſay; and it was Chiefly upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that I could never be prevail'd upon to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Method of theſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Phyſicians in this
caſe; I was rather contented that they ſhould call
in thoſe <hi>Pandites,</hi> and take their Remedies from
their own hands, without my Approbation.</p>
                     <p>Thus it hapn'd to a certain religious Perſon,
who during my ſtay on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi>
being taken dangerouſly ill of a Dyſentery with a
Fever, and finding that the Remedies which I had
preſcrib'd did not produce the deſir'd effect, he
asked my conſent to call in a <hi>Pandite,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done accordingly, he preſcribed the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
five or ſix Doſes of <hi>Opium,</hi> mixt with Oil
and <hi>Jagre,</hi> or <hi>Suchar</hi> of the <hi>Coco's,</hi> by which
means he ſent the Patient to the other World.</p>
                     <p>It was no ſmall diſſatisfaction to me, to find,
that all the Remedies I apply'd in this caſe, did
not anſwer the deſir'd Effect, which raiſed in me
an extraordinary deſire, of finding out ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,

                        <pb n="241" facs="tcp:57955:136"/>
I had obſerved among the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that they
preſcribed only <hi>Cange,</hi> Rice, Bread, and Chaly-beat-water
in the <hi>Bloody-Flux,</hi> and that, after
ſome gentle Purgations, they made uſe of <hi>Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Medicines,</hi> entirely rejecting the uſe of the
Curds and of <hi>Opium</hi> of the <hi>Pandites.</hi> This Method
I muſt confeſs, as it appears more reaſonable, ſo
I thought it muſt be more ſecure than that uſed by
the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this not giving me all the Satisfaction I
could wiſh for in this caſe, I got at laſt, by good
fortune, acquainted with a certain Perſon, who
having liv'd for many years together in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
taught me a certain Preparation, which is as
eaſily taken as prepared, by the help of which,
and certain Rules to be obſerved in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Diet, I have cur'd a great many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> on Ship-board, and in <hi>France,</hi>
after my return from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not to be deny'd, but that the <hi>Flux</hi> may
proceed from different Cauſes, and that therefore
there ought to be a ſuitable Change to be obſerv'd,
both in relation to the Remedy and Diet, but
this being no difficult task for a Phyſician, who
underſtands the true nature and cauſe of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
I am well aſſur'd, that, provided, the
Patient be not too far gone, it never fails to cure
any Dyſentery of what nature ſoever.</p>

they apply to the place where the Adder has fixed
her Poyſon, where the Stone faſtens it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other help, and having ſuck'd in as much
of the Poyſon, as it is able to contain, it falls off;
Then they put it in Milk, where having diſcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

afreſh in the ſame manner, as before, till ſuch time
that it will not faſten no longer, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

                     <p>It is obſervable, that when this Stone is put in
Milk to diſcharge the Poyſon, the Milk appears
as if Excrements had been put into it, and
of ſeveral Colours. I have been frequently an
eye-witneſs of the ſtupendious effects of this
Stone; but the worſt is, that it is a great Rarity
to meet with a good one, there being abundance
of Counterfeit ones, who have not the ſame
Vertue.</p>
                     <p>If it therefore happen that any one be bitten
by an Adder, and you have not any of theſe
true Stone, at hand, the beſt way is to have that
part where the Wound is, ſcarified, and by the
help of Cups to draw as much Blood from thence
as you can; afterwards apply to the place ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
as have a peculiar Vertue to attract Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
from the Center of the Body to it Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
For which purpoſe it is convenient, to
keep the Wound open for a conſiderable time, to
uſe Juice of Citrons or Limons, in every thing
you eat, drink Wine, and take inwardly the true
Powder of Vipers, provided it may be had una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated.
Theſe are, in my Opinion, the moſt
proper Antidotes to be made uſe of, upon ſuch an

                     <p>The firſt is occaſioned by a certain kind of a
Worm, long and pretty thick, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
in the Legs, cauſes moſt cruel Pains, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57955:139"/>
very ſordid Ulcers, and laſt of all, an
incurable Gangrene, if you don't prevent it in
time; by opening the Skin where it lies, from
whence you may draw out the Worm by winding
of it gradually round a large Needle or ſmall
Sticks, but very gently, for fear of tearing the
Worm in pieces, in which caſe you muſt make a
large Inciſion, to take out the remaining part;
The Worm being remov'd, you may apply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Detergents to the Ulcer, and afterwards Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catriſe
it, after the ordinary way.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bicho</hi> of the ſecond kind is a Worm, but
ſo ſmall, as it is impoſſible to be ſeen by the moſt
clear-ſighted. They are in great quantities in rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Houſes, as well as new Buildings, and among
Excrements and Duſt.</p>
                     <p>They enter inſenſibly thro' the Pores of the
Skin, eſpecially in the Feet, inſinuate themſelves
betwixt the Fleſh and Skin, and will ſometimes
ſettle under the Nails. The <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Braſilians,</hi>
who go bare-footed, are often troubled with
them, and the <hi>Europeans,</hi> tho' they commonly
wear Shoo's and Stockins, are not always free
from this Miſchance. Theſe ſmall Worms, don't
cauſe any immediate Pain; on the contrary, it is
a great while before you are ſenſible of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you carefully look upon your feet every day.
But they ſoon increaſe in your Skin, and in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fifteen days time, grow as big as a Pea,
and do eaſily diſcover themſelves by their black
Colour. The ſafeſt way is, to take them out as
ſoon as you are ſenſible of them; for the longer
they remain in the Skin, the more difficult they
are to be taken out; and, if they are there long
enough, they will cauſe a Corruption, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
ſuch malignant Ulcers, that I have ſeen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<hi>Negro's,</hi> to have the Fleſh of their Feet
corrupted in ſo miſerable a manner, that the bare
Bones appear'd.</p>
                     <p>It is next to an impoſſibility to avoid catching of
theſe Worms: The only way is to take care not to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57955:140"/>
let them ſettle long in the Skin; for if they be
taken in time, they are not attended with any
conſiderable ill conſequences. If they have cauſed
any Corruption or Ulcers, they may be cur'd after
the common way, after you have taken out the
Worms, or have kill'd them with Tobacco-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Beſides this, the <hi>Portugeſes,</hi> living on the
Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> are peſter'd with another Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which they call <hi>Bicho;</hi> This is an Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Fundamental, which as it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
ſo it is no leſs dangerous in this Country;
Heat-aches and Burning-heats in the affected part,
being the conſtant companions of theſe Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are often not without a Fever; and
if neglected, produce in a few days time very
malignant Ulcers, from whence this Diſtemper
has gotten the name <hi>Bicho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such as keep theſe parts clean by waſhing them
often with fair Water only, are leſs ſubject to this
Evil, than ſuch as do otherwiſe. As ſoon as you
find your ſelf ſiez'd by this Diſtemper, bath it
oftentimes a day with a Decoction made of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and mix with it a little Salt. You may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
put with good ſucceſs Slices of Limons within
your Fundament, which often cures the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
without any more ado, if you take it in the
beginning. But if it be already gone into a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
they uſed to dilate ſome Gun-powder
with a ſufficient quantity of Roſe or Plantain-Water,
in which Liniment they dip ſome Linen-Rags,
which they put in the Fundament, not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to bath it before with the Decoction of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
Special care is to be taken, that if a Fever
appear in this caſe, not to let blood, it having
been found by Experience, that it has always
prov'd prejudicial. It is much more ſafe to keep
conſtant to Anodyne and Deterſive Clyſters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Corruption or Inflammation is more
or leſs, and to conclude the whole Cure with a
gentle Purge.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had formerly in their Poſſeſſion
ſeveral Forts in this Iſland, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
taken from them, and Demoliſhed them. The

two choiceſt were called <hi>Tinkemale</hi> and <hi>Battecalo,</hi>
ſituate betwixt the ſeventh and eighth Degree of
Northern Latitude.</p>
                     <p>The Laſt of theſe two is ſituate upon a River
diſemboguing in a very fair Bay,<note place="margin">Battecalo.</note> where there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſafe riding at Anchor for Ships, who may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any danger enter the River which is both very
large and deep. On the point of this Bay there
might be built a Fort, which would lie very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to Command the Bay.</p>
                     <p>I am well aſſured that the King of <hi>Ceylon</hi> would
be willing enough to beſtow this tract of ground
upon a Foreign Prince, in caſe they would aſſiſt
him againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who export the Cinnamon
in prodigious Quantities, without paying any Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
under pretence that they having been at
great Expences to deliver that Iſland from the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi>
they ought to keep ſuch Cities and Forts
as they have taken from the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and (which
by virtue of a Treaty made with the King of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
they were to deliver into his hands) in their
poſſeſſion as a pledge for their money till it be
repaid, and that in the mean while they take the
Cinnamon on diſcount of the intereſt.</p>
                     <p>There might eaſily a correſpondence be ſetled
betwixt <hi>Battecalo</hi> and the City of <hi>Candie,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence

                     <p>Not far from the City of <hi>Candie,</hi> towards the

                     <p>The moſt are of opinion, that the ill Succeſs of

of <hi>Betton.</hi> This Kingdom is under the 42th
Degree, about 300 Leagues North from the Mouth
of the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> which diſembogues into the
Sea of <hi>Bengalle,</hi> being ſurrounded on all ſides with
unacceſſible Rocks. The King of this Country,

a Bulwork againſt any Attempts of the Enemies.
The Inhabitants are all of a white Complexion,

it be a few among them who Trade to <hi>China,</hi>

a She-Goat; The Inhabitants catch them a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">How they Catch this Creature.</note>
and ſhoot them with Arrows. Sometimes
they dig Holes and thus catch them in the Trap.
They have alſo another way of entangling them
in Nets, and ſo knock them on the head; For they
faſten very large Nets round the Woods where
they know them to reſort in whole Troops; which
done, they make a noiſe with a certain Inſtrument,
called by the Inhabitants, <hi>Gomene,</hi> which having
a ſound moſt like our Bells, theſe Creatures are

Bladder of a Semicirculer Figure, one part being
joined to the Fleſh, which being full of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Subſtance, is ſometimes bigger and plumper,
ſometimes leſs and flatter; Theſe Subſtance is theſe
that we call Musk.</p>
                     <p>Great care muſt be taken in gathering this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
not to break the Bladder or Veſſel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
it,<note place="margin">How Musk is gathered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> for fear of looſing part of ſo precious a
Commodity. To prevent which, they commonly
cut ſome ſmall part of the Fleſh where it adjoins
to it, out with the Bag, which, after it becomes
dry, is eaſily ſeparated from it, when it appears
like a Ball and one entire Bag, if it be otherwiſe,
they ſuppoſe it to be Adulterated. They have
a way of ſewing up the Slit ſo artificially, that it is
very difficult to be diſcerned.</p>

of all Matters relating to their reſpective

                     <p>The Perſons choſen for the diſcharge of ſo great

Piety, and ſuch other Qualifications as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

ſo much conſequence to the whole Nation.</p>
                     <p>Perſons of a Noble Extraction and equally Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with ſuch Endowments, when ſtrengthened
with ſo great a Character, are moſt ſuitable to the
Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who living under the
Juriſdiction of a great and vertuous Prince at
home, don't without Reluctancy ſubmit to the
Commands of others, who have ſcarce any title to
their Greatneſs, than perhaps bare chance, and are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57955:160"/>
more beholding for it to Fortune than their own
Merits. We ought in this Point to follow the
footſteps of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who have found their
Viceroy's in the <hi>Indies,</hi> (who are always choſen out
of the Nobleſt Families of <hi>Portugal</hi>) prove very
advantageous to their Affairs.</p>
                     <p>I would have the Sea-Captains to be choſen for
that Service, of betwixt 35 and 45 years of Age;
If they be much older, their frequent Trials and
Hazards of the Seas, makes them more timerous
than they ought to be; whereas young People are
more daring, and conſequently much more proper
to undertake thoſe Hazards which muſt needs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
new Diſcoveries and unknown Countries.</p>
                     <p>I take it for granted, that there are few places
in thoſe parts, were this Company ſtrengthned and
eſtabliſhed under the Protection of <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi>
may not eſtabliſh themſelves, either by the Conſent
of the Inhabitants or force of Arms; wherefore I judge
it adviſable to eſtabliſh Colonies on the <hi>African</hi>
Coaſt, about 600 Leagues diſtant from one
another at fartheſt, and among the reſt to take
care that one may be ſettled as near as poſſibly can
be near the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> Some there muſt
alſo be eſtabliſhed in <hi>America,</hi> but eſpecially on
the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil.</hi> It would alſo be very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to make our ſelves Maſters of one of the
Iſlands under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> near the <hi>African</hi>
Coaſt; where care muſt be taken to build a good
Fort for the ſecurity and conveniency of ſuch as
from time to time ſhould be ſent thither from
<hi>France,</hi> the better to inure them by degrees to the
Sea-Air and the Hot Climate.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Places will be of great ſervice at one
time or other to the <hi>French</hi> Ships in their Voyages
to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it being unqueſtionable, that
one of the main Inconveniencies in thoſe long
Voyages, proceeds from the want of convenient
Harbouring where to refreſh themſelves; and to
ſeek for a place of Retreat among Strangers is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
chargeable, and ſeldom granted but under very
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57955:161"/>
ſtrict Limitations, and conſequently ought not to
be relied upon, nor to be made uſe of but in caſe
of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe places will alſo afford another conſiderable
advantage, which is, that ſuch Perſons that have
lived there for ſometime, may be carried with
much better proſpect to the <hi>Indies,</hi> than theſe,
who but lately were brought out of <hi>Europe,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they being already accuſtomed to the
heats of the Climate, their conſtitution muſt needs
be more agreeable to the Climate of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would adviſe to carry to the <hi>Indies</hi> no other but
Secular Prieſts, the reſt being generally Ambitious
and too much addicted to their own Intereſts, and
always intermeddling with State-Affairs, and
ſuch other Matters as have not the leaſt affinity
with the Character they ought to bear in the
World.</p>
                     <p>I would have this Company take this for a
Maxim in their Colonies: <hi>One Nation, one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> mixed with the <hi>French,</hi> and the
<hi>Hugonots</hi> with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> did never live in a
good Union. We are obliged for this to the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> that in <hi>France</hi> there is now
but one, and that the true antient Religion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſee I the leaſt reaſon, why the <hi>French</hi> ſhould
have any occaſion to make uſe of ſtrangers in their
Colonies in the <hi>Indies.</hi> I am well aſſured that the
<hi>French</hi> are alone in a capacity to live under what
Climate ſoever; They Inhabit a Country ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Spaniards, Portugeſes, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi>
who have eſtablſhed themſelves under the <hi>Torrid-Zone,</hi>
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and in <hi>America.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To give the <hi>French</hi> their due; there is not a
more Civiliz'd Nation in the World, their Manners
and Converſation being look'd upon as moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Introduce themſelves in all places. Beſides
which they are very Populous, Brave and Daring,
which makes them have an eaſie acceſs wherever
they come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I appeal to experience, the kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
they met with in the Empire of the <hi>Great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57955:161"/>
Mogul,</hi> of <hi>Calicut, Siam,</hi> and other places in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> of late years, are ſo many convincing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
that theſe Princes received them in
their Territores with a more than ordinary ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Care ought to be taken that ſome Perſons may
be ſent into <hi>Japan,</hi> to undeceive that Prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the wrongful opinion the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> are
prepoſeſs'd with in prejudice of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And all opportunities ought to be courted to
get footing in this, as well as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>But it ought to be obſerved, that the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with theſe Negotiations in theſe two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
as well as in the other parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
ought to be men of Experience and Authority:
Theſe, as well as all other publick Affairs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
ought not to be left to the management
of Merchants; as it is in <hi>Holland,</hi> where Merchants
have a great ſhare in managing Affairs of ſtate, and
the Courts of Juſtice, and conſequently are better
qualified for ſuch buſineſs than thoſe of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Care ought to be taken that from time to time,
Envoy's may be ſent to thoſe parts, who may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one another; and that they may be provided
with good Yearly Salleries which muſt be paid
them exactly, without being pinch'd in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
by thoſe who have the management of
the Treaſury in their hands. For if Perſons in ſuch
a Station find themſelves neglected, they will be
ſure to loſe no opportunity to retrieve themſelves
at any rate.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo abſolutely neceſſary for the Company,
to have a Certain City both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
which lying, as near as can be, in the Center
of the <hi>French</hi> Colonies, muſt be the reſidence of
the Generaliſſimo's, each in his reſpective place.
The Cities ought to be of an Advantagious ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both in reſpect of their Fortifications and the
conveniency of their Harbours.</p>
                     <p>The Iſle of <hi>Madegaſcar</hi> ought to be conſidered
as the chief place of Retreat for ſuch Ships of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57955:162"/>
Company as Sail to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> I am abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
of opinion, that the firſt project made in
<hi>France</hi> concerning that Iſland, ought not to be laid
aſide, but is to be purſued to all its intents and
purpoſes. For beſides that, it is not for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>France</hi> thus to abandon an Enterpriſe,
which they look'd upon as ſo advantagious to the
Nation; The ſituation of this Iſland, its Products
and Riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſufficient Invitations for us to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
our Colonies among them.</p>
                     <p>It ought to be taken into Conſideration, that
this Iſland lies betwixt the two <hi>Indies,</hi> there is as
good a Road near <hi>Fort-Dauphine,</hi> and in the Bay of
<hi>Antogil.</hi> Beef there is in ſuch plenty, that we have
taken forty Thouſand Oxen at a time, after we
had defeated one of their <hi>Grands.</hi> Wild-Fowl,
Fiſh, Fruits, Grapes, Honey and Wax it produces
in great abundance, and the very Mountains bring
forth good ſtore of Rice. Their Waters are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
good, and the Ground is very Rich and
Fruitful. There is not the leaſt queſtion, but that
if the Grounds were carefully cultivated they
would produce very good Wheat, and the Grapes
might be brought to maturity. But if it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
Wheat may be eaſily Tranſported thither
from <hi>Suratte,</hi> from the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandet,</hi>
where it is very Cheap. The defect of
good Wine might be eaſily ſupplyed from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
Iſlands, where it coſts not above four Pence a
Pint, and a Pint conſidering its ſtrength, will
go further than a Quart of <hi>French</hi> Wine; beſides
that, this Wine gows better by keeping, it being
much finer after it has lain four years, than it was
at the firſt. It would alſo be no difficult matter to
tranſport thither of our <hi>Grave</hi> Wine, <hi>Perſian</hi> and
<hi>Goat</hi> Wines, and as much Brandy as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>There is ſcarce any Commodity which the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>

                     <p>I cannot be perſuaded, that what the Natives tell
us is true; to wit, that what Gold they have, was
brought into the Iſland by ſome Ships which Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
came near that ſhoar, whereof ſome periſhed
thereabouts; there being ſcarce a Man or Woman
ſo mean, but what have ſome Golden Ornaments
about them; not to mention here the Treaſures
hoarded up by their <hi>Grands,</hi> which they never
touch but in caſe of the greateſt extremity; and
ſeems to be a convincing argument, that there are
ſome Gold Mines in this Iſland.</p>
                     <p>The Sieur <hi>de la Caſe</hi> was not ignorant of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and Monſieur <hi>de la Milleray,</hi> was ſo well
convinced of the Riches and true Value of the
Products of this Iſland, that he would never part
with his right, while he lived.</p>
                     <p>The Sieur <hi>de Caron</hi> got once into his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a piece of Amber-Greeſe, weighing Eighteen-Ounces.
There is a Prodigious quantity of Silk
and Cotton in the Iſland, and yet theſe are the
chief Commodities, which are brought out of the
Territories of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and of fourteen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings, his Tributaries, who all muſt be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by great Preſents to allow the Exportation of
theſe Commodities.</p>
                     <p>As for the Air of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> it is very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and pure, witneſs thoſe of its Inhabitants
who arrive to a great age, it being common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to ſee ſome of a Hundred and Twenty
years of Age. It cannot be deny'd, but that it has
not proved ſo agreeable to the <hi>Fren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h</hi> conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but if the matter be duly weighed, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that this proceeded more from the change of
Diet, and from their carleſneſs in not keeping
their Stomachs warm, than from any other cauſe;
For I have made this obſervation, that thoſe born
under a cold Climate, if tranſported into thoſe
parts, ought not to neglect that point, as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their health and lives.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:57955:163"/>
There is one objection to be made, to wit:
That ſeveral other Nations, who have taken a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Inclination to P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ant their Colonies here; But this
I think derogates nothing from the true value
which ought to be put upon this Iſland. For it is
poſſible,<note place="margin">Why other Nations never ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Iſland.</note> that theſe Nations who are leſs powerful
than the <hi>French,</hi> being before ſettled in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
